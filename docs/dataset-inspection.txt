         'rants at “Scientific” American. With the excuse of Halloween, it’s '
         'even sillier than usual.\n'
         'In 2018, the idea that we need a special holiday to be scared feels '
         'a little strange. Zombies, vampires, and werewolves don’t seem so '
         'frightening when the real world provides us with Vladimir Putin, '
         'white supremacists, and greenhouse gas emissions. And trust me, as a '
         'climate scientist, I’m frightened every day. Watching our best '
         'projections of future climate is like watching a horror movie you '
         'can’t walk out of. And the worst part is the willful ignorance of '
         'the characters. I mean, who could be so stupid as to walk straight '
         'into a house they know is haunted?\n'
         'These “best projections” apparently include the ratpocalyse:\n'
         'The hallway teems with rats, some the size of human infants. Climate '
         'change, it has been pointed out by skeptics, will be good for some '
         'species. And this turns out to be true, just not for humans. The '
         'shorter winters mean longer breeding seasons for urban rats, and '
         'they’re manifestly enjoying themselves. In these increasingly ideal '
         'breeding conditions, two rats can, within three years, turn in to '
         'almost half a billion.\n'
         'It’s an amazing coincidence, I’ve noticed, that climate change is so '
         'discerning in its effects on wildlife — anything cute and cuddly, '
         'like say, to choose such an animal at random, a koala, is going to '
         'be threatened by climate change, but any nasty animal like a rat is '
         'going to increase catastrophically in just a few years.\n'
         'Now of course it’s easy for us to laugh at charlatans like Marvel, '
         'and the organisations that are so keen to give people like her a '
         'platform. But the point of this post is not just to ridicule another '
         'so-called scientist making things up (“There is no beer”) to promote '
         'her political agenda.\n'
         'The serious point is that because scientists are generally regarded '
         'as trustworthy, the actions of people like her have serious '
         'consequence for other people’s mental health. Some people, '
         'unfortunately, perhaps those who are more vulnerable, have less '
         'understanding of science, or less experience of previous bogus scare '
         'stories, really believe this nonsense, and are terrified.\n'

         'Indeed. Being going on for many years, apparently with many of the '
         'environmental and climate front line professionals themselves '
         'affected first, sometimes to the point of needing treatment. See the '
         'excerpt below from a series at WUWT back in 2014, ‘Wrapped in Lew '
         'Papers: The psychology of climate psychologization – Part3’. This is '
         'what happens when avid belief collides head on with reality. But it '
         'is to be doubted that the ‘climate prophets’, which label even von '
         'Storch used and he’s no skeptic, lose any sleep at all over such '
         'consequences. They believe avidly too, so they think they are '
         'striving to do the noblest thing, so the only issue that’s likely to '
         'keep them awake at night is: ‘are they doing enough to save the '
         'world’?\n'
         '—-excerpt—-\n'
         'In another recent series of messages from environmental scientists '
         'in Lewandowsky’s homeland of Australia, at Scared Scientists (h/t '
         'WUWT),the emotive focus shifts from a sympathy-grabbing sadness and '
         'bewilderment to a straight pitch at fear, as one might gather from '
         'the label of these guys and gals. Each of 8 messages (1 from each '
         'scientist) is headlined in capitals ‘FEAR: XYZ’, where XYZ is the '
         'particular fear each scientist claims is their particular biggy. '
         'Aside from the usual parasitical memes of alarm getting a cozy '
         'living once more, overall the transmission of misinformation about '
         'the certainty of various dooms, plus the certainty in the simplistic '
         'solution, is quite something to behold. This is a very strong pitch '
         'indeed; it seems these scared scientists haven’t seen the research '
         'threads mentioned in post 2 (from within the Consensus!) pointing '
         'out that fear-based appeals don’t work and tend to turn people off. '
         'Or maybe they ignored that; the whole exercise has more than a whiff '
         'of desperation. The kind of desperation folks feel when the real '
         'world crashes into the serious cultural bias one has been soaked in '
         'for years, or maybe decades; in this case, the culture of '
         'catastrophe founded upon the misinformation of certainty.\n'
         'In the article ‘a climate of despair’ from the Syndey Morning '
         'Herald, we learn that climate depression (aka “ecoanxiety” or '
         '“doomer depression” or “apocalypse fatigue”) is apparently not '
         'uncommon, and on the rise. Psychologist Susie Burke is quoted in the '
         'article:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙“We can be very sure that many people in the field of climate '
         'change are distressed – highly distressed – and it can have a '
         'significant psychosocial impact on their wellbeing.”\n'
         'The article highlights the case of one sufferer, biologist and '
         'ecologist Nicole Thornton, who slid towards some kind of breakdown '
         'after the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference. In her '
         'own words:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘“Every time I talked about environmental issues, I would '
         'start crying, which I think is a really unusual response,” she says. '
         '“I’m a scientist, so I like to break things down – to drivers and '
         'causes – but I was confused. I had never heard of anyone who had '
         'something like this.”’\n'
         'Fortunately Thornton sought help and is much improved, now using her '
         'experience to help others.\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Thornton, 41, is currently on a break – of sorts. She is part '
         'of a fellowship program with the Centre for Sustainability '
         'Leadership, with 49 other aspiring change agents. She is using her '
         'time in that program to create an online health and wellbeing hub, '
         'catered to cases like her own. “Peers have talked to me about '
         'burnout, anxiety, panic attacks, complete disengagement, and '
         'frustration leading to despair and, when you think about it, this '
         'stuff is always around you in the environmental field. It’s '
         'notorious. They get so involved, and they’re so passionate and they '
         'don’t take breaks.’\n'
         'The really interesting thing is that there appears to be an awful '
         'lot of folks needing help, and some of the symptoms discussed in the '
         'article are serious. Yet this is exactly what one would expect from '
         'a clash of reality with cultural bias. ‘Apocalypse fatigue’ is a '
         'highly appropriate term. The Consensus has massively oversold the '
         'certainty of apocalypse, leading to bewilderment and despair, and '
         'worse, within its ranks as they perceive the world is not reacting '
         'sufficiently. In the minds of these unfortunate folks, we are '
         'driving towards a brick wall at high speed, why wouldn’t they be '
         'stressed?!\n'
         'There is not a whiff of skepticism in this Sydney Morning Herald '
         'article; all is pitched from a Consensus viewpoint regarding '
         'attitudes to climate change. For instance early this year, Burke '
         'presented on mental health and the environment at one of Al Gore’s '
         'Climate Reality shindigs. Yet despite they are trying to help, '
         'apparently no professionals have even started to question, at a '
         'fundamental level, why their ‘weary campaigners’ are falling over '
         'like ninepins. Instead, they seem to be concentrating on sticking '
         'plasters:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Burke has gone so far as to release “tip sheets” to help '
         'people face the reality of climate change without a sense of dread – '
         'a kind of step-by-step guide for managing feelings and changing '
         'behaviour.\n'
         'She and her colleague, Dr Grant Blashki of the Nossal Institute for '
         'Global Health at the University of Melbourne, have even been called '
         'on by organisations that need help dealing with the overall '
         'melancholy affecting their troops.’\n'
         'Actually sticking plaster is probably a very kind description. Most '
         'of the webpage for the tip sheets is about changing behavior to be '
         'more eco-conformant, not in any way that might address one’s actual '
         'psychological problem. The sticking plaster sections recommend '
         'taking a break from news and TV, spending time with loved ones (well '
         'fine, but this is a ‘sugar meme’), being optimistic (good) and being '
         'well-informed (great… but An Inconvenient Truth is suggested). Hmmm… '
         'given a high court judge ruled regarding An Inconvenient Truth that '
         'nine key errors arose “in the context of alarmism and exaggeration”, '
         'and that the “apocalyptic vision” presented in the film was '
         'politically partisan and not an impartial scientific analysis, does '
         'anyone think this would be a good cure for one’s eco-anxiety or '
         'apocalypse fatigue? Even if there were zero errors in it, would yet '
         'another apocalyptic vision be a workable cure? The ‘change your '
         'behavior’ parts of the webpage (by far the majority) include many '
         'eco-friendly things one is advised to do, plus other behaviors such '
         'as ‘associate with like-minded people’ and ‘encourage others to '
         'change’. Depending on the eco-policies supported this may or may not '
         'be good for the planet (some eco-policies seem to be causing more '
         'distress and damage than good, for instance the bio-fuel debacle), '
         'but either way this isn’t going to actually address a sufferer’s '
         'core psychological problem. And any cult leader would recognize a '
         'basic formula beneath the gentle and erudite words here: perform the '
         'acts of faith, associate with the faithful, convert the unfaithful. '
         'Even if all this was provably and unquestionably ‘right’ regarding '
         'the bigger picture, such advice is all about helping the cause, not '
         'about helping the individual.\n'
         'Other supposed healers such as psychotherapist Rosemary Randall, '
         'take the same ‘change your behavior’ approach in an attempt to cure '
         '‘climate anxiety’ using discussion groups:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Through conversation, we have a lot of material which we use '
         'in the groups which show people where the emissions are and what the '
         'actions are that they can do to affect that. We talk about what the '
         'obstacles are, and what the process is of making those changes.’\n'
         'This is all much too reminiscent of telling shell-shocked troops to '
         'simply pull themselves together, believe in the next big push, and '
         'get back in the trenches to carry on fighting; recommendations given '
         'before shell-shock became a recognized medical condition. There '
         'appears to be a similar and sizeable gap in understanding here; a '
         'major inconsistency with how mental trauma would be analyzed and '
         'addressed in non-climate domains.\n'

         'Hey, my post of 10:16 just disappeared, doesn’t even say ‘in '
         'moderation’ now! Here’s what I think I said as close as I can '
         'remember:\n'
         'Indeed. This has been going on for years, and apparently first '
         'affected the environmental and climate front line professionals, to '
         'the extent that some of them needed treatment. See the excerpt below '
         'from the 2014 series at WUWT, ‘Wrapped in Lew Papers: The psychology '
         'of climate psychologization – Part3’. This is what happens when avid '
         'belief collides with reality. However, the ‘climate prophets’, a '
         'term used by Von Storch and he’s no climate skeptic, will not lose '
         'any sleep over this consequence. They are avid believers too, so the '
         'only thing they are likely to lose sleep over is, ‘am I doing enough '
         'to save the world?’\n'
         'Just in case, this time I’ll put the excerpt in a separate post '
         'below, and with all the embedded links stripped out too…\n'

         '—-excerpt, this time with all the embedded links taken out—-\n'
         'In another recent series of messages from environmental scientists '
         'in Lewandowsky’s homeland of Australia, at Scared Scientists (h/t '
         'WUWT), the emotive focus shifts from a sympathy-grabbing sadness and '
         'bewilderment to a straight pitch at fear, as one might gather from '
         'the label of these guys and gals. Each of 8 messages (1 from each '
         'scientist) is headlined in capitals ‘FEAR: XYZ’, where XYZ is the '
         'particular fear each scientist claims is their particular biggy. '
         'Aside from the usual parasitical memes of alarm getting a cozy '
         'living once more, overall the transmission of misinformation about '
         'the certainty of various dooms, plus the certainty in the simplistic '
         'solution, is quite something to behold. This is a very strong pitch '
         'indeed; it seems these scared scientists haven’t seen the research '
         'threads mentioned in post 2 (from within the Consensus!) pointing '
         'out that fear-based appeals don’t work and tend to turn people off. '
         'Or maybe they ignored that; the whole exercise has more than a whiff '
         'of desperation. The kind of desperation folks feel when the real '
         'world crashes into the serious cultural bias one has been soaked in '
         'for years, or maybe decades; in this case, the culture of '
         'catastrophe founded upon the misinformation of certainty.\n'
         'In the article ‘a climate of despair’ from the Syndey Morning '
         'Herald, we learn that climate depression (aka “ecoanxiety” or '
         '“doomer depression” or “apocalypse fatigue”) is apparently not '
         'uncommon, and on the rise. Psychologist Susie Burke is quoted in the '
         'article:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙“We can be very sure that many people in the field of climate '
         'change are distressed – highly distressed – and it can have a '
         'significant psychosocial impact on their wellbeing.”\n'
         'The article highlights the case of one sufferer, biologist and '
         'ecologist Nicole Thornton, who slid towards some kind of breakdown '
         'after the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference. In her '
         'own words:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘“Every time I talked about environmental issues, I would '
         'start crying, which I think is a really unusual response,” she says. '
         '“I’m a scientist, so I like to break things down – to drivers and '
         'causes – but I was confused. I had never heard of anyone who had '
         'something like this.”’\n'
         'Fortunately Thornton sought help and is much improved, now using her '
         'experience to help others.\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Thornton, 41, is currently on a break – of sorts. She is part '
         'of a fellowship program with the Centre for Sustainability '
         'Leadership, with 49 other aspiring change agents. She is using her '
         'time in that program to create an online health and wellbeing hub, '
         'catered to cases like her own. “Peers have talked to me about '
         'burnout, anxiety, panic attacks, complete disengagement, and '
         'frustration leading to despair and, when you think about it, this '
         'stuff is always around you in the environmental field. It’s '
         'notorious. They get so involved, and they’re so passionate and they '
         'don’t take breaks.’\n'
         'The really interesting thing is that there appears to be an awful '
         'lot of folks needing help, and some of the symptoms discussed in the '
         'article are serious. Yet this is exactly what one would expect from '
         'a clash of reality with cultural bias. ‘Apocalypse fatigue’ is a '
         'highly appropriate term. The Consensus has massively oversold the '
         'certainty of apocalypse, leading to bewilderment and despair, and '
         'worse, within its ranks as they perceive the world is not reacting '
         'sufficiently. In the minds of these unfortunate folks, we are '
         'driving towards a brick wall at high speed, why wouldn’t they be '
         'stressed?!\n'
         'There is not a whiff of skepticism in this Sydney Morning Herald '
         'article; all is pitched from a Consensus viewpoint regarding '
         'attitudes to climate change. For instance early this year, Burke '
         'presented on mental health and the environment at one of Al Gore’s '
         'Climate Reality shindigs. Yet despite they are trying to help, '
         'apparently no professionals have even started to question, at a '
         'fundamental level, why their ‘weary campaigners’ are falling over '
         'like ninepins. Instead, they seem to be concentrating on sticking '
         'plasters:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Burke has gone so far as to release “tip sheets” to help '
         'people face the reality of climate change without a sense of dread – '
         'a kind of step-by-step guide for managing feelings and changing '
         'behaviour.\n'
         'She and her colleague, Dr Grant Blashki of the Nossal Institute for '
         'Global Health at the University of Melbourne, have even been called '
         'on by organisations that need help dealing with the overall '
         'melancholy affecting their troops.’\n'
         'Actually sticking plaster is probably a very kind description. Most '
         'of the webpage for the tip sheets is about changing behavior to be '
         'more eco-conformant, not in any way that might address one’s actual '
         'psychological problem. The sticking plaster sections recommend '
         'taking a break from news and TV, spending time with loved ones (well '
         'fine, but this is a ‘sugar meme’), being optimistic (good) and being '
         'well-informed (great… but An Inconvenient Truth is suggested). Hmmm… '
         'given a high court judge ruled regarding An Inconvenient Truth that '
         'nine key errors arose “in the context of alarmism and exaggeration”, '
         'and that the “apocalyptic vision” presented in the film was '
         'politically partisan and not an impartial scientific analysis, does '
         'anyone think this would be a good cure for one’s eco-anxiety or '
         'apocalypse fatigue? Even if there were zero errors in it, would yet '
         'another apocalyptic vision be a workable cure? The ‘change your '
         'behavior’ parts of the webpage (by far the majority) include many '
         'eco-friendly things one is advised to do, plus other behaviors such '
         'as ‘associate with like-minded people’ and ‘encourage others to '
         'change’. Depending on the eco-policies supported this may or may not '
         'be good for the planet (some eco-policies seem to be causing more '
         'distress and damage than good, for instance the bio-fuel debacle), '
         'but either way this isn’t going to actually address a sufferer’s '
         'core psychological problem. And any cult leader would recognize a '
         'basic formula beneath the gentle and erudite words here: perform the '
         'acts of faith, associate with the faithful, convert the unfaithful. '
         'Even if all this was provably and unquestionably ‘right’ regarding '
         'the bigger picture, such advice is all about helping the cause, not '
         'about helping the individual.\n'
         'Other supposed healers such as psychotherapist Rosemary Randall, '
         'take the same ‘change your behavior’ approach in an attempt to cure '
         '‘climate anxiety’ using discussion groups:\n'
         '∙∙∙∙∙∙‘Through conversation, we have a lot of material which we use '
         'in the groups which show people where the emissions are and what the '
         'actions are that they can do to affect that. We talk about what the '
         'obstacles are, and what the process is of making those changes.’\n'
         'This is all much too reminiscent of telling shell-shocked troops to '
         'simply pull themselves together, believe in the next big push, and '
         'get back in the trenches to carry on fighting; recommendations given '
         'before shell-shock became a recognized medical condition. There '
         'appears to be a similar and sizeable gap in understanding here; a '
         'major inconsistency with how mental trauma would be analyzed and '
         'addressed in non-climate domains.\n'

         'The late Oceanographer Robert E. Stevenson, was Secretary General of '
         'the International Association for the Physical Science of the Oceans '
         'from 1987 to 1995, and worked as an oceanographer for the U.S. '
         'Office of Naval Research for 20 years. He had a lifetime career of '
         'hands-on ocean research.\n'

         '“The atmosphere cannot warm until the underlying surface warms '
         'first. The lower atmosphere is transparent to direct solar '
         'radiation, preventing it from being significantly warmed by sunlight '
         'alone. The surface atmosphere thus gets its warmth in three ways: '
         'from direct contact with the oceans; from infrared\n'
         'radiation off the ocean surface; and, from the removal of latent '
         'heat from the ocean by evaporation.\n'
         'Consequently, the temperature of the lower atmosphere is largely '
         'determined by the temperature of the ocean.\n'
         'Inland locations are less restrained by the oceans, so the surface '
         'air experiences a wider temperature range than it does over the '
         'oceans. Land cannot store heat for long, which is why hot days are '
         'quickly followed by cold nights in desert regions. For most of the '
         'Earth, however, the more dominant ocean\n'
         'temperatures fix the air temperature.\n'
         'Because of the high density/specific heat of sea water, the entire '
         'heat in the overlying atmosphere can be contained in the top two '
         'meters of the oceans. This enormous storage capacity enables the '
         'oceans to “buffer” any major deviations in temperature, moderating '
         'both heat and cold waves alike.\n'
         'Sunlight penetrates the water surface readily, and directly heats '
         'the ocean up to a certain depth. Around 3 percent of the radiation '
         'from the Sun reaches a depth of about 100 meters.\n'
         'The top layer of the ocean to that depth warms up easily under '
         'sunlight. Below 100 meters, however, little radiant energy remains. '
         'The ocean becomes progressively darker and colder as the depth '
         'increases.\n'
         'Thermohaline circulation is responsible for the formation of the '
         'bottom-water masses in the world’s oceans: the North Atlantic Deep '
         'Water (NADW) originates basically in the region of the Labrador Sea; '
         'the Weddell Sea is the source of the deep-water in the circumpolar '
         'Southern Ocean; and the Pacific Deep Water originates in the Ross '
         'Sea. In many other places in the oceans, and seas, as well, surface '
         'waters are carried into the depths by thermohaline circulation.\n'
         'So, it is not surprising that those modellers who “need” to get warm '
         'surface waters to move into the depths of the oceans, and remain '
         'sequestered there for long periods of time, would turn to the '
         'physical mechanism of this vertical circulation system. Their hope '
         '(claim) is that there can be occasions when\n'
         'salinity, rather than temperature, is the prime determining factor '
         'in the density of the surface waters. Then, warm water, made dense '
         'by an increase in the sea’s salt content, would sink. It does not '
         'happen!\n'
         'The oceans, by virtue of their enormous density and heat-storage '
         'capacity, are the dominant influence on our climate. It is the heat '
         'budget and the energy that flows into and out of the oceans that '
         'basically determines the mean temperature of the global atmosphere. '
         'These interactions, plus evaporation, are quite capable of '
         'cancelling the slight effect of man-produced CO2.”\n'

         'This is key; scientists are definitely NOT special. As even '
         'Lewandowsky knows, and is pretty much universally accepted, “being '
         'human, scientists operate with the same cognitive apparatus and '
         'limitations as every other person”.\n'
         'There are as you imply various cultural associations with the '
         'enterprise of science itself, including elements that are both good '
         'and bad for that enterprise. A culture of encouraging objectivity is '
         'good, for instance. A huge culture of blind belief in the authority '
         'of science in the modern world, is not so good; this causes many to '
         'believe in that which is successfully characterised as science, even '
         'when it is abject nonsense. The culture of objectivity is very weak '
         'compared to the strength of a full-on religion or extreme political '
         'ideology / philosophy, even when the latter are entangled with a '
         'science issue, perhaps especially so. It’s even weak compared to '
         'moderate in-domain group-think. Hence science is very fragile to '
         'cultural hi-jacking, which writ small or large happens constantly. '
         'In the long term, it may win out, but long could be generations, and '
         'for instance several centuries of modern science have not yet placed '
         'religion into the minority, and very many scientists are religious '
         'too. Because science is highly cellular, especially in modern times '
         'where disciplines are broken down to tiny branches of each subject '
         'tree, most scientists know jack-shit about the other branches. Their '
         'culture of ‘being a scientist’ (so, fraternal) often works to '
         'undermine objectivity regarding the branches their colleagues are '
         'working on, which makes the arrangement peculiarly vulnerable to '
         'cultural takeover in a way that is more not less likely than for '
         'non-scientists. They are more likely to believe the abject nonsense '
         'if it is ‘science’ from a different branch. The increasing kudos of '
         'the ‘scientist’ label, especially in super-star domains like climate '
         'science, hugely exacerbates this problem, just one source of bias '
         'among many.\n'
         'I’m glad you brought up the medical profession. Medical '
         'professionals also have scientific training, plus a stronger '
         'professional culture than generic science, centred upon the '
         'Hippocratic oath, due to the nature of their domain and need for '
         'objective compassion (e.g. they are meant to heal an enemy as well '
         'as they would a friend). An example of how such seemingly firm '
         'constraints can so easily be twisted by a major culture, is the '
         'self-motivation of local doctors regarding the killing of disabled '
         'children in 1930s / 40s Germany. Armed with sanction from Hitler '
         'obtained using the single letter from a father asking to euthanize '
         'his disabled baby, chief of the chancellery Philipp Bouhler '
         'instigated a pseudo-legal system requiring 3 doctors to fill in a '
         'form agreeing to the euthanizing of disabled babies. This system '
         'extended and evolved (lower thresholds, increase from babies to '
         'children) over the years through actions of the doctors themselves. '
         'There was no further instruction from Hitler, no more from Bouhler, '
         'whose forms were eventually dispensed. The doctors themselves simply '
         'created a virtually industrial level system and decided themselves '
         'who to kill, putting ‘measles’ or some such on the death '
         'certificate. They genuinely thought that they were ‘cleansing the '
         'race’, doing great (net) good for their society, and they wanted to '
         'please officials like Bouhler, who wanted what he thought would '
         'please Hitler, all of which was part of the current cultural '
         'alignment. There was no imposition from above, no threat from '
         'authority, the action was utterly counter to their oath, yet their '
         'objectivity was so compromised they felt it was still, on balance, '
         'the best course to take (with eugenics supplying most of the '
         '‘scientific’ underwriting). Compared to this, the case in climate '
         'science is far more easy to comprehend, and far less contradictory, '
         'yet the underlying mechanisms are the same. While the triggering and '
         'detailed configuration happens in software (culture), the basic '
         'sense of right and wrong, of perceiving evidence and balance and '
         'such, is altered in hardware. If the h/w has a red filter, you won’t '

         'adherents than folks who are objective on this issue, whether '
         'scientists or not; they include all the memetic width they have '
         'swallowed, which makes catastrophe perfectly interpretable from the '
         'texts even when it may not actually say so.\n'
         '13) Far more non-climate scientists and science /policy interfacers, '
         'especially in the area of ecology, propagate climate catastrophe. '
         'They are motivated to care about the environment and due to the '
         'cellular thing above, are easily co-opted by strong culture.\n'
         'I’ve learned that in a highly conflicted science topics, especially '
         'if it’s immature, scientific knowledge is little help (I have a '
         'degree in physics, no use whatsoever for the wicked climate system). '
         'There is huge width for uncertainty, and even the science of '
         'uncertainty is disputed and the levels of need or otherwise of the '
         'precautionary principle. It is more objective to ignore all the '
         'domain data. My position on the issue does not stem from scepticism '
         'of physical climate science, and to avoid bias I try not to delve '
         'there. My position comes from the social data, which says that '
         'climate catastrophism ticks every box for a strong culture. '
         'Therefore it is wrong, because the main narrative of all strong '
         'cultures are wrong.\n'
         'You can’t notice or not a case for something if the very equipment '
         'you’re using for noticing has a pre-determined conclusion, operating '
         'in fundamental ways which you are not conscious of, and for sure the '
         'complexity of climate science is easily broad and deep enough to '
         'allow such mechanisms to triumph in scientists, albeit a small '
         'minority currently propagate a narrative of the catastrophic. The '
         'very same equipment tells the owner that those who ‘interfere’ '
         '*must* be nefarious. I think you are partly wrapped around the axle '
         'on the issue of culpability, which is very secondary I think. There '
         'won’t be a Nuremburg if the culture wins, or even if it morphs to '
         'something else and eludes our probing on the original issues. Nor '
         'have the great majority of those scientists propagating the '
         'narrative done anything legally wrong (with a very small number of '
         'exceptions). Morals are a different thing. Those doctors above made '
         'up their own laws; had Germany won we’d all agree by now that their '
         'morals were ok too, and indeed leading edge for the time. Given they '
         'lost, we can hardly imagine anything morally worse. The case for '
         'climate scientists going too far due to their strong beliefs is '
         'enormously less stark than this, and even if the culture collapses '
         'prosecutions would not be in order. The negative impacts on society '
         'are not due to them, they are driven as much as driving, it is due '
         'to the whole phenomenon, most of which sits outside of science '
         'anyhow. We’d much more usefully rail against the mainstream (who '
         '*don’t* believe) for their failure in 8) above. Although there is '
         'much debate in social psychology about whether propagating group '
         'deceptions is lying or not, the current tentative position is not; '
         'our hardware is reconfigured, and in any case the brain is a choir '
         'not a solo singer, so which singer inside is lying to which other '
         'singers, is the real investigation. Insomuch as the law survives the '
         'cultural wave (I hope so), and professional codes / ethics (some '
         'definite transgressions there!) likewise, everything should be '
         'thrown at transgressors. But a tiny focus on this for a few climate '
         'scientists is likely counter-productive; the challenge / trampling '
         'of huge swathes of law regarding renewable energy or facking or '
         'whatever is a much more immediate issue.\n'
         '‘But it WOULD be nice if someone, somewhere in the climate academy '
         'had the integrity to risk a bad performance review in order to blow '
         'the whistle on the routine betrayal of the scientific method before '
         'it becomes normalised.’\n'
         'This is *hugely* relevant. It is ever the case that cultures self '
         'police themselves through fear of the sanction of peers. The most '
         'influential catastrophe narrative comes from a large raft of world '
         'leaders, who per above falsely (they are not lying, they believe '
         'this) claim the mainstream support of science. It takes bravery '
         'indeed to push back on that. Many scientists would have to band '
         'together, but for the first few it would be, it is, ugly. Which '
         'doesn’t mean that I sympathise with the silence of the majority.\n'

         'It occurs to me that my previous response was simplistic. In fact, '
         'when it comes to CAGW and calculations of uncertainty, three '
         'categories of technical error have been made:\n'
         'a) Errors that facilitate the cultural hi-jacking of the science. '

         'guidance note on consistent treatment of uncertainties: a common '
         'approach across the working groups” (2011)).\n'
         'b) Errors that result from the cultural hi-jacking of the science. '
         'For example, when cognitive scientists recognise the importance of '
         'cognitive biases in decision-making and the evaluation of '
         'uncertainty or risk, and yet exhibit a total professional '
         'disinterest in those biases that unreasonably promote belief in '
         'CAGW.\n'
         'c) Errors in which the cultural hi-jacking of the science is '
         'irrelevant. For example, the failure to appreciate the limitations '
         'of probabilistic techniques in the assessment and propagation of '
         'uncertainties.\n'

         'Your argument supports my case more than your own 😉 The reason the '
         'British / Australian cloaks appear so thin as to be embarrassing, is '
         'because culture is strong, affects everything people do, and '
         'expresses itself in all sorts of modes and biases that simply cannot '
         'be disguised, even by someone with great skill who is trying to wear '
         'such a cloak. The ‘specialness’ of science otoh has no such deep '
         'behavioural characteristics, and can very easily be worn as a cloak '
         'which will be believed by anyone who’s *already culturally '
         'convinced*. And even by very many who aren’t unless they have the '
         'significant time and skill to delve into great detail, especially if '
         '(e.g. for the CC case), despite not being directly aligned to '
         'climate catastrophism, they nevertheless as a primary algorithm '
         'believe everything that is touted as mainstream science (this itself '
         'being a cultural downside of the enterprise of science). The '
         'situation in your lecture room is as Alan describes (thank you '
         'Alan); the great majority of climate scientists in there are already '
         'culturally convinced; the few who aren’t feel oppressed by the '
         'cultural majority (which has great power and scope to affect all '
         'aspects of their career / life). Depending upon the country in which '
         'the lecture is held, the non-scientists will mainly be split by '
         'affiliation (where support versus innate+reasoned scepticism has '
         'become aligned to older cultural conflicts), or more arbitrarily '
         'split (where support versus innate+reasoned scepticism has not so '
         'aligned). So as examples of the former, in the US the non-scientists '
         'will mainly be split along Dem / Rep lines. In Germany, support will '
         'be from centre right folks, and opposition from the left and the far '
         'right. In the UK, both support and opposition will cross all main '
         'political party lines. I also agree with Alan regarding '
         'non-scientists more generally; after decades of soaking in '
         'scientific fiction / fact programs / events / books, with massive '
         'university attendance in the modern era and a huge push on stem for '
         'years, they typically know well enough what science is and they will '
         'give much more push-back than the scientists in the room (this is '
         'part of the reason why so few such sessions occur that are open to '
         'the public). BUT, push-back will only be from those sections of the '
         'audience who are aligned in opposition.\n'
         'I’m not qualified to ‘judge’ any topics, even climate science, and I '
         'don’t. As far as I can determine climate catastrophism ticks all the '
         'boxes for a culture, hence my proposition is that it *is* a culture, '
         'and I’ve done various posts (mostly at Climate Etc) in support of '
         'this proposition. Years ago Lewandowsky did great work (with others) '
         'on misinformation. This work applied to the climate domain, shows in '
         'every way that climate catastrophe narrative is indeed '
         'misinformation. So I did apply it in detail, as a series over at '
         'WUWT a few years back. This is far more useful, and far, far less '
         'easy to defend against, than merely calling out Lew as loony. Part '
         'of the reason he’s had to try and turn all of psychology on its head '
         'is to avoid this clash, a major cognitive dissonance for him.\n'
         'There is no magic way to tell if ‘science’ is really science. The '
         'great majority of climate scientists are not catastrophists (albeit '
         'searching only in English, I find only 8 out of 831 AR5 WG authors '
         'publicly propagating catastrophe narrative). The majority of what '
         'those who do believe in and propagate this narrative are doing, '
         'would look just like science, unless one stands over their shoulder '
         'all day every day to spot occasional passing incremental bias '
         'incidents. The culture of catastrophism lives mostly outside of '
         'science, and for those adherents still on the inside cultural '
         'defensiveness (which means co-ordinated at a deep level) will not '
         'let anyone stand over their shoulder, indeed it needs years of '
         'forensics a la McIntyre to see the decay of long unaddressed '
         'systemic bias – cultural bias. There are also many good scientists '
         'in the wider climate / ecology domain, who due to the cellular thing '
         'are nevertheless convinced – do you really think that thousands and '
         'thousands of scientists are all liars or evil because they believe? '
         'And all their work thereby invalidated – not science? Is Steven '
         'Hawking’s work on the evaporation of black holes gibberish because '
         'he said the Earth would become like Venus if we didn’t meet '
         'emissions policy goals? I may be putting words in your mouth here, '
         'yet that is the line you seem to be implying above. It is worth '
         'noting too, that all of the scientists who are at the fringe end and '
         'for sure are supporting / propagating catastrophe, absolutely and '
         'fully believe that they are indeed good scientists, which makes it a '
         'hell of a lot easier for them to present as exactly that.\n'

         'a) yes, among others, but unless cultural bias had already gotten a '
         'pretty deep foot in the door, this kind of definition would likely '
         'never have been proposed, or at least never approved, in the first '

         'c) I think highly relevant. The failure to appreciate this issue is, '
         'as noted above, an expectation of cultural bias. If culture has one '
         'job, it is to create certainty around a cultural narrative whose '
         'propagators are its in-group. It therefore (literally) disables the '

         'within the climate change domain at least, among many other '
         'suppressed / de-emphasised issues, this one would be paramount.\n'
         'As noted above, and notwithstanding a potential start from '
         'incompetence, if not subject to systemic bias the fuller enterprise '
         'of science should in time fix anything deemed worth fixing. Climate '
         'science is these days not only deemed important, it may well be '

         'such culture had compromised or overridden the flight safety '
         'procedures that govern every level of design, implementation, test, '
         'maintenance, repair, inspection and operation of an airframe and '
         'every single participating subsystem and component within it, and '
         'how had these compromises added up to cause a serious evasion of the '
         'multi-layered nets setup to catch issues, then I’d consider it a '
         'reasonable report that had correctly identified a cultural issue. If '
         'a report could find little of note regarding systemic negative '
         'culture and consequent compromising of procedures (or potential '
         'future compromising yet to hatch) per above, yet there was still a '
         'major flight failure, then we’re likely looking at a new phenomenon '
         'whether technical or organisational or whatever that was not '
         'anticipated by current design or operation or whatever procedures, '
         'and such need updating for future prevention. This can happen as '
         'aircraft design evolves, especially the rapid changes towards ‘fly '
         'by wire’ in recent history, and further changes for instance in the '
         'military such as total artificial all sky vision.\n'
         'Flight safety procedures are geared to be acultural. In principle, '
         'following them to the letter with no culture at all, +ve or -ve, '
         'will result in safety. A ‘safety culture’ is primarily to ensure '
         'adherence to the endless tedious procedures (and vastly increased '
         'expense), because humans don’t gel well with tedium, plus we can '
         'never make procedures that could anticipate everything since we’re '
         'simply not clever enough. So a culture of safety takes the spirit of '
         'the procedure and also goes the extra mile, especially for newer '

         'volunteering to contribute to appropriate committees to update or '
         'gain peer approval from outside / oversight orgs before committing '
         'to flight, and inserting extra tests / safeguards / prototype hours '
         'etc. A lack of competence is not something that should ever fall '
         'through these procedures in any way; this is not a new problem its '
         'one of the oldest, and the design procedures (where competence '
         'issues would normally impact most) are geared for it. Which doesn’t '
         'mean to say that anyone believes the procedures to be completely '
         'bullet-proof in that respect, for instance regarding the determinism '
         '( = predictable safety) of multi-core processors as flight control '
         'computers, which has taken years and years to work through the '
         'system and (for 4 cores at least) is just about there. For such a '
         'new and highly challenging area, incompetence from say Intel '
         'designers (who are not designing for flight and therefore not '
         'working to flight safety procedures), could get through the '
         'procedural and overall system design filters that are intended to '
         'mitigate the use of ‘commercial off the shelf’ silicon for flight. '
         'But many folks are all over this, bright minds and much money and '
         'big orgs and years and years of incremental progress. If it goes '

         '“As far as the uncertainty analysis surrounding CAGW is concerned, I '

         'catastrophe is not even in science, it is outside, and though it '

         'indeed there is a small minority of adherents ‘on the inside’), this '
         'is why the IPCC working group papers do not in fact support the '
         'notion of a high certainty of global catastrophe (absent major '
         'emissions reduction). However the aforementioned huge bias, while it '
         'hasn’t caused the majority to sign to catastrophe yet, does affect '
         'the whole of climate science and pretty much all ecology and many '
         'other disciplines too. Think religion, which crosses political and '
         'job functions and many other boundaries. This is the scope of '
         'climate catastrophism, albeit it is still a pup compared to '
         'Catholicism. I feel I’m repeating myself now but I’ll try to keep it '
         'simple. This is touted to be the biggest problem in the world, '
         'likely has the most scientists engaged on it (if you cover all '
         'aspects), legions of new bright talent, has previously unheard of '
         'and eye-watering levels of funding, and due to this high profile the '
         'attention of all scientific disciplines including pretty much all '
         'the expertise in the world, who I’m sure in most cases would be only '
         'too eager to help. Yet you think *only* mere incompetence is holding '
         'up this entire show? And for 30+ years (climate sensitivity is no '
         'more bounded over this timescale, let alone more subtle issues)? '
         'Given all those parameters above, why on Earth do you think that '
         'incompetence could possibly survive all this time? For an issue '
         'touted as existential for the planet never mind a bit of flight '
         'safety. It survives, along with a narrative of catastrophism that '
         'defies even mainstream science never mind anything sceptic, and IPCC '
         'group-think and such compromised procedures as Brad frequently '
         'refers to and all the rest of the circus, because a culture is '
         '*maintaining* all these. Without that cultural maintenance, the '
         'proper addressing of uncertainty along with all the rest, would have '
         'happened long ago and certainly long before we reached a spend of '

         'understanding what “the scientific method” means. That, you need to '
         'be taught.”\n'
         'If this were truly so, then there would be no conflicted areas of '
         'science ever, because you personally, along with everyone else who '
         'knows the scientific method, would simply be able to tell very '
         'quickly which side of any conflict is ‘the science’, and which is '
         '‘the BS’. Yet society is constantly riven by conflicts related to '
         'science issues, and indeed the enterprise of science itself is '
         'constantly riven by conflicts on its own topics that don’t make it '
         'out to wider society, and the defenders of all positions in all such '
         'conflicts claim (and nearly always believe too) that *they* are '
         'indeed demonstrating the scientific method, and can show so too. '
         'Often, and especially for immature science areas, there is far too '
         'much complexity and way too much uncertainty for any definitive '
         'opinion to actually be formed, which gives group-think its '

         'in question is perceived to be one of high social impact. '
         'Fortunately, most topics are not perceived to have high social '
         'impact, and reams of good science just get done under the cultural '
         'radar. Yet even then this is no guarantee; e.g. the tectonic plate '
         'debacle, which held back geology for about 50 years and into the '
         'modern era (my geology teacher was to some extent a victim of '
         'consensus action during his own training). Within all this, the '
         'detection of some duff science (we are all fallible), or even some '
         'duff scientists, does not show a whole ‘side’, composed of many '
         'thousands of contributors, for instance, is wrong, and typically in '
         'any large conflict there will less than stellar efforts on both '
         'sides, good efforts on both sides, and even a few dire efforts on '
         'both sides. Of course if one side is enormously bigger, there is '
         'much more scope for variety there. Such realities are helpful in '
         'allowing cultural take-over to survive blows one would think ought '
         'to be fatal, yet when culture has also turned blind eyes to max and '
         'extended demonization barbs to ‘interference’, then survive scandals '

         'who hear it will believe it too, why wouldn’t they? However, it does '
         'rather bely the fact that as noted, even mainstream science clearly '
         'and obviously doesn’t support the catastrophic, which can be seen '
         'from AR5 WG papers, for instance. No skeptics required. But when '

         'the individuals concerned, is that they are being honest. Indeed '
         'passionately, fervently honest, like the religiously inspired, for '
         'instance. And anecdotally, this is exactly what we see in the '
         'climate convinced; they display all the symptoms of being subject to '
         'a group deception, and typically* none of the body language signs of '
         'lying (unfortunately there is not a formal survey on same, because '
         'all the relevant surveyers belief the strong CC narrative is hard '
         'science, so why would they do this). *=there will be some bad apples '
         'in every barrel of humans, of course, I speak of the big majority '
         'here, plus those at one fringe who are so fervent / frustrated they '
         'will be driven to noble cause corruption, which form another small '
         'minority. Should the debate on these issues (it is immature science) '
         'lean back towards lying, and think we’re certainly at the stage '
         'where it would have to be deemed a very special form of lying that '
         'is not what we normally think of with this word. Some very early '
         'work with brain scans suggests that group deceptions utilise the '
         'same machinery that hypnotists take advantage of to appropriate '
         'someone’s will, leading to the suggestion that this is why such '
         'hardware exists. b) the alternative is not only that thousands and '
         'thousands of folks are lying, not only climate scientists but many '
         'others, but that all these liars are consciously co-ordinating with '
         'each other over decades and as many new folks enter the field too. I '
         'think belief in that would deserve the kind of label that Lew likes '
         'to hand out. In cultures, the co-ordination is achieved at the '
         'fundamental behavioural level, everyone sings off the same hymn '
         'sheet at the level of instinct, with cues constantly reinforced by '
         'endless retransmission of the cultural narrative and its subordinate '

         'Indeed not, if you mean it in some sort of sense of self-evident. '
         'Social phenomena such as CAGW, such as religions or extremist '
         'politics, are *group* phenomena. We are group thinkers (e.g. per '
         'Michael Gazzaniga), and these phenomena can only be understood at '
         'the group level, but including the parts of the brain architecture '
         'that specifically evolved to support group thinking, aka cultures, '
         'write small or large. The best you can say about a single '
         'individual, is whether their quotes and actions are consistent with '
         'cultural belief or not. Even if they are, there is great danger to '
         'attributing too much to an individual (e.g. Oreskes per your above '
         'example). While we are group thinkers, we are not uniform group '
         'thinkers, we have thoughts in all sorts of directions, and culture '
         'comes along like a wave and pushes the mass of folks in a particular '
         'direction (or opposite direction, cultures always cause some '
         'polarization). This is made worse by the fact that several cultures '
         'are doing this at once and some of them interact. So a particular '
         'individual could be anywhere on the map, for instance, could be an '
         'inveterate liar, could be whatever. And its also true that cultural '
         'waves offer all sorts of opportunities for a parasitical living both '
         'for those who are not conscious of their modus operandi and for some '
         'who certainly are. The CRU emails, which rightly appalled even some '
         'on the orthodox side (e.g. Monbiot, albeit he seemed to stage a '
         'recovery), are a great insight into the middling stages of a culture '
         'already exerting enormous moral pressure, certainly enough for noble '
         'cause corruption, and certainly enough for the hockey team to '
         'genuinely believe that folks such as McIntyre were fossil-fuel '
         'backed shits of the first order, despite they may have found ‘one or '
         'two useful points’, which they made ‘far too much of’ (I '
         'paraphrase). In the absence of culture (whether you view the tiny '
         'core domain action in isolation so as group-think, or in the wider '
         'context of the whole CAGW social juggernought). Look at this quote '
         'regarding Enron:\n'
         '“Groupthink, therefore, increases the risk of corporate dishonesty. '
         'Just as individual dishonesty is always a part of trying to preserve '
         'or negotiate our self-image, so group dishonesty is fundamentally '
         'linked to preserving the corporate image. As McLean and Elkind wrote '
         'in the context of Enron: “Enron’s accounting games were never meant '
         'to last forever . . . The goal was to maintain the impression that '
         'Enron was humming along until Skilling’s next big idea kicked in and '
         'started raking in real profits . . . In Skilling’s mind, there was '
         'no way he was going to fail. He had always succeeded before, and his '
         'successes had transformed the company. Why would it be any different '
         '[now]?”\n'
         'The ‘corporate image’ and therefore the ‘corporate culture’ of very '
         'many organisations and teams, e.g. the IPCC or the UK Met Office, or '
         'various whole branches of science, has become almost synonymous with '
         'climate change being a very major problem, albeit still not always '
         'officially catastrophic, yet that spectre is emotively pushing them '
         'all. One might speculate regarding climategate and also during some '
         'panic around the pause and pause-busting series etc, for instance: '
         '‘their data accounting games were never meant to last forever . . . '
         'The goal was to maintain the impression that Climate Change was '
         'humming along until the next big temperature upswing kicked in and '
         'started raking in the real rewards and recognition.’ And the '
         'cultural persuasion and power of CAGW utterly dwarfs the kind of bad '
         'corporate culture that led to Enron’s group-think; after all once '
         'it’s inside your head, look what’s at stake! Which means you aren’t '
         'just getting a few intermittent pulses from the brain architecture '
         'that supports this stuff, it’s full-on max power all the time, for '
         'the core adherents.\n'
         '“I’ve repeatedly argued that they DON’T believe.”\n'
         'Then, speaking generally about many individuals rather than focusing '

         'why they all do what they do which doesn’t disappear into a whole '
         'creaking tower of conspiracy theories? But it’s also true we should '
         'check what we both mean by ‘believe’ here. I mean it in the '
         '‘religious’ sense, if you will (indeed religions work on the very '
         'same mechanisms). Hence WITH all the many contradictions this brings '
         '(suppressed for the believers). Belief in this sense is NOT arriving '
         'at a conclusion through reason, and indeed reason will be brought '
         'into service in order to shore up the belief position by any means '
         'possible (along the lines of Kahan), plus all sorts of filters and '

         'about the quality of his own execution of science.\n'
         '“Far from it. It’d be a moral duty.”\n'
         'Indeed, which is why so many do express belief and verge close to or '
         'into activism and policy rather than just science.\n'
         '“My point, however, is that it’s never sincere when scientists do '
         'it.”\n'
         'Hmmm… which unless I’ve misunderstood you here flies in the face of '
         'the clear passion expressed by very many scientists in support of '
         'the CAGW phenomenon, and your agreement that they’re obviously not '
         'all liars, plus contradicts the above agreement on Hawking, who is '
         'only 1 example of those many.\n'
         '“As a matter of public record / empirical fact, no known scientist '
         'has converted to alarmism from skepticism upon closer inspection of '
         'the climate evidence for themselves.”\n'
         'I’ve seen mention of several cases other than the (non) case of '
         'Muller, though I’ve never followed them up. For sure it’s consistent '
         'with all my above (which is not to say I would ever have predicted '
         'it ): As noted above, many scientists may only be pulled into '
         'nominal support through weak cultural links, such as the fraternity '
         'of science, but if they should look into it for whatever reason, and '
         'they’re far from already emotively convinced, they may indeed be '
         'very unhappy with what they see. The problem with those who for '
         'whatever reason become more emotively committed *before* they start '
         'such a search, is that their search itself and their trust of '
         'sources they’re using to ‘validate’, will be hugely biased, and for '
         'instance they may pass over McIntyre or read aggressively his work '
         '(e.g. some very knowledgeable commenters have and still give very '
         'credible challenges over there, which gives Steve a lot of work to '
         'carefully unravel, however usually not convincing the challenger). '
         'Hence one would not expect an avalanche of scientists to become '
         'skeptic unless the whole culture hits a crisis point, most would be '
         'too emotively committed before they peek in. There is another '
         'expected route to skepticism though; all cultures create a sceptical '
         'backlash (it’s a balance mechanism). This is seen in all publics, '
         'whether or not it aligns to other pre-existing cultural boundaries '
         'While this is a cultural mechanism itself and not based on reason, '
         'with all the attendant issue of that, it could be that a small '
         'number triggered into innate scepticism are themselves scientists, '
         'and hence when they start looking they will already be biased to '
         'look *more* at sceptical sources, not less, and with a greater bias '
         'to believe those sources. I think it much less likely that those '
         'who’ve detected the religious nature of the CAGW phenomenon will go '
         'the other way, but for sure atheists sometimes get religion, and I '
         'wouldn’t rule it out especially for individuals who happen to be '
         'very emotively pressured in the right ways.\n'

         'John: “The IPCC was set up to be an expert authority. So one should '
         'not be surprised when it behaves like an expert authority. One does '
         'not need a cultural explanation for its over-confidence – the '
         'problem is inherent in the concept. Furthermore, it was set up to '
         'establish a consensus and so one should not be too surprised by its '
         'obsession with consensus as a metric for uncertainty.”\n'
         'Absolutely it was setup to establish a consensus. This consensus '
         'owing a great deal to culture; as noted above it is the ‘job’ of '
         'culture to create (and spread) a consensus, brooking no uncertainty. '
         'If you think the consensus is not culturally derived, where did it '

         'the undue and damaging influence of a relatively small group of '

         'there is an overarching cultural influence, it is an expectation of '

         'proposing that the IPCC consensus and its particular treatment of '

         'too, are best explained by noting the heavy cultural influence that '

         're: ‘the core narrative of all strong cultures are wrong’ and '
         'similar wordings.\n'
         'The evolutionary purpose of cultures, and the brain architecture '
         'that grew to support them, is to define an ‘in-group’. If we don’t '
         'know who is the in-group, we can’t apply that other deep instinct, '
         'altrusim. It is only applied to the in-group, and the out-group '
         'don’t get our precious help and goodies, and indeed to ensure '
         'there’s a strong demarcation to *ensure* they don’t get our help and '
         'goodies, the out-group are generally shunned or even demonised. So '
         'culture provides, on a constant and constantly updated basis, via a '
         'cultural narrative (actually a set underneath an umbrella theme), '
         'cues for who is in-group and who is not, which triggers at a deep '
         'behavioural level in us whether we are going to b nice to them or '
         'not, whether we believe anything they say or not, whether we will '
         'help them or attack them, etc etc.\n'
         'So via the cultural narrative banner ‘yahweh is our one and only '
         'God’, beneath which is the detail we call the Old Testament, '
         'including such stuff as that he is a super being and created the '
         'universe etc, is created an in-group. As this in-group became very '
         'large, it split to competing sub-groups called Judaism and Islam and '
         'Christianity, each with their own rule book variants, but this is a '
         'detail. The point being that the narrative is complete BS. There is '
         'no God. It’s a ‘group deception’ that serves to trigger the deep '
         'behaviours in us that keep the in-group and hence its altruistic '
         'advantage together, and fend off / attack other such groups. This '
         'example seems obvious, but…\n'
         '…the reason why the cultural narratives are wrong is that to work '
         'they have to be utterly certain, and because the world (pre-science '
         'and hence experiment) had no certainties you could usefully hang a '
         'group on, they had to be invented. And indeed, even now, it’s '
         'essentially impossible to get everyone to agree to a single way to '
         'steer their lives when there is actually immense complexity in both '
         'the real world and also within the immense range of social '
         'possibilities that we could explore. The solution is simple and '
         'culture provides it, an arbitrary basic belief that everyone can buy '
         'into, and sufficiently interpretable that everyone sees what they '
         'want to see in it, yet at the same time heavily enforced and '
         'brooking no uncertainty. Committing to these seemingly contradictory '
         'beasts is built into our deep instincts, yet in order to satisfy the '
         'many constraints of achieving this apparent miracle, including that '
         'the beliefs must be above all question (hence as far from reality '
         'checks as possible), that have to be untrue.\n'
         'So just like the real purpose behind narratives such God and the '
         'bible is to make an in-group, which if it sticks around long enough '
         'will create detailed ‘rules for living’ for the group, ‘our group’. '
         'But the core narrative, i.e. God himself, the angels, the devil and '
         'all that paraphanalia are just cultural co-ordination amd identity '
         'for the group. Similarly for the social phenomena of CAGW. Even '
         'without reading AR5 and noting that a high certainty of global '
         'climate catastrophe is not supported, one knows that CAGW is wrong '
         'because it ticks all the boxes for a culture. So it is just a flag '
         'saying who this new in-group is, and all the sub-narratives are just '
         'co-ordination and more identity details and indeed starting to '
         'accmulate ‘way of living’ for this group. Whether ACO2 is good, bad, '
         'or indifferent, this in-group flag, this narrative, is wrong like '
         'all the endless others throughout history.\n'
         'Re strong or weak, this is best done by example; I gave some above. '
         'Even the kind of group-think that destroyed Enron (so very '
         'significant impacts) is very weak compared to say a major religious '
         'culture or an extremist political one, or indeed CAGW.\n'

         'repeat that, the ONLY source of information a person can use to form '
         'justifiable beliefs is scientific evidence (because that’s the ONLY '
         'type of information that actually works—the rest are useless)\n'
         'i’m sure you’re nodding and saying “yeah yeah we all know that,” but '
         'if by the end of this you still don’t get why my thesis is logically '

         'so, again:\n'
         'the ONLY source of information a scientist (or anyone, by the '

         'way that not only makes it too obvious for words but resists '
         'verbalization\n'
         'so very few scientists would be able to explain this as well as me '
         '(and I’m not doing that great a job of it)\n'
         'they won’t tell you this stuff, not only because it’s very very hard '
         'to put into words, but they have no idea whatsoever that you need to '
         'be told it in the first place!\n'
         'it never occurs to 99.9% of scientists that an educated person could '
         'fail to know all this as a matter of course\n'
         'it took me a LONG time to figure out that people on the so-kalled '

         'that “our” so-kalled “side” takes for granted\n'
         'but as I said: they may not be able to put it into words, but ALL '
         'scientists understand this stuff\n'
         'there’d have to be something clinically wrong with a scientist’s '
         'brain if cultural factors were able to override scientific evidence\n'
         'for instance, try naming a “scientific belief” I hold because '
         'cultural forces made me believe it in the face of scientific '
         'evidence pointing the other way\n'
         'you won’t be able to, because there’s nothing (very) wrong with my '
         'brain\n'
         'most of my beliefs are wrong or at best inexact, as are everyone’s, '
         'which is why I try to avoid having them when I can help it, but my '
         '“scientific beliefs” are based on [my knowledge of] the scientific '
         'evidence, which justifies them without by any means guaranteeing '
         'that they’re right.\n'
         'but none of this applies to Hawking example. why not? because he '
         'didn’t follow the climate debate. so his opinions about it were '
         'wild-ass guesses, influenced no doubt by the CULTURE of signalling '
         'virtue by endorsing carbon taxes, and ipso facto were unjustified '
         'grey-lit rubbish\n'
         'and just to show i’m even handed, his statements would be no better '
         'justified if he’d guessed correctly and scoffed at CAGW (though '
         'that’s improbable—a TV scientist would be crazy to do that in our '
         'culture, wouldn’t he?).\n'
         'no shortage of people on our “side” deny CAGW in a non-scientific '
         '(and almost always fallacious) manner all the fricking time. people '
         'who move from ‘Socialism sux” to “AGW isn’t real” are best ignored. '
         'Yes, culture culture culture is at work in these people. of course. '
         'obviously. but people like that aren’t reasoning, and their “ideas” '
         'don’t matter, and they’re a million miles from being scientific.\n'
         'anyway hawking shouldn’t have said anything when people nudged him '
         'to comment on stuff he hadn’t studied.\n'
         'it was unscientific to give in to the temptation to answer.\n'
         'it is not a hanging crime. it’s sign of na overweening vanity and '

         'no. I have no view on whether that is the case or not, and I didn’t '

         'scientist is trained to look for. it’s implausible in the extreme. '
         'it wouldn’t actually happen. this is not a matter of IQ differences. '

         'Hawking didn’t look for it, the git, so he should have shut his git '
         'mouth.\n'
         'BTW, in terms of your own arguments, you are still making some '
         '(incorrect) assumptions about the way scientists reason about '

         'ALMOST ALWAYS) ambivalentddd.\n'
         'CAGW is a very special case, because there is ZERO evidence for it.\n'
         'If that statement seems impossible to take literally, and '
         'reminiscent of fundamentalist/zealous rhetoric, it should!\n'
         'But it isn’t.\n'
         'What you need to recall is that all scientific evidence comes from '
         'hypothesis-testing. You need to test hypotheses to get evidence '
         'pro/con.\n'
         'But what if you spend thirty years NOT TESTING the hypothesis, but '
         'instead studiously doing everything BUT what a proper scientist '
         'would do?\n'
         'Then you could spend thirty years yelling at everyone who doesn’t '

         'That’s what they’ve done.\n'
         'It’s appalling and stunning to me. Daylight robbery. I’m not aware '
         'of any precedent, though I might have to look into eugenics history '
         'a bit more.\n'
         'Anyway, in non-pathological, '
         'non-international-trillion-dollar-fraudulent science, winners and '
         'losers aren’t decided by evidence-free yelling, but by a '
         'gradually-coming-into-focus body of evidence.\n'
         'Even when one “side” turns out to be wrong in the end, it did boast '
         'SOME evidence suggesting it might be right.\n'
         '“because you personally, along with everyone else who knows the '
         'scientific method, would simply be able to tell very quickly which '
         'side of any conflict is ‘the science’, and which is ‘the BS’.”\n'
         'No.\n'
         'In normal (pre-climate-science) science, neither side is “BS”. '
         'Everyone obeys the scientific method and acts like scientists. So '
         'every paper they come up with, no matter which “side” it seems to '
         'support, is science. It’s all science.\n'
         'If one side is “right”, it’s because the scientific evidence taken '
         'as a whole—not cherry picked—makes that side more plausible.\n'
         'But this whole idea of two “sides” is wrong anyway. Science doesn’t '
         'work that way. Climate science does, but science doesn’t. (Which is '
         'one reason why the former doesn’t work at all, and the latter '

         'field of science. Any of them. Doesn’t matter which.\n'
         'If you advocate a hypothesis (which you should only do AFTER you’ve '
         'begun testing it, and assuming it’s survived the tests thus far, '
         'unless you want to embarrass yourself), other scientists are '
         'nevertheless free to remain “skeptical” (doubtful) of the idea.\n'

         'advocate their doubts, i.e. to promote the complementary position '
         '(Andy’s idea is wrong).\n'
         'The null hypothesis needs no advocate. It needs no champion. It can '
         'speak for itself, thanks very much. It can stand up for itself.\n'
         'Why not?\n'

         'If you’re wrong, nature—the data—will prove you wrong.\n'
         '“Skeptics” (in the sense in which we’ve been cast in the climate '
         'debate) play no part in scientific debates.\n'
         'They don’t have to present a case. They don’t have to do one measly '
         'bit of research. They don’t even have to turn up to the debate.\n'

         'this endorsement by nature (in the form of empirical data observed '
         'by testing the hypothesis) is definitive.\n'
         'When you fail—and chances are you will, because a hypothesis is just '
         'a guess and most guesses, by their very nature, are wrong—it won’t '
         'be some other scientist who defeats you in some adversarial, '
         'TV-courtroom-drama-style contest of beliefs.\n'
         'It’ll be your own experiment that debunks your idea.\n'
         'And so what? No big deal. You go back to the drawing board. You’re '
         'not a bad scientist just because you eliminated a possible '
         'explanation. Far from it. That’s your job.\n'
         'Most hypotheses fail.\n'
         'Not 50%, not sixty, not seventy. NINETY EIGHT PERCENT or so fail, '
         'either straight away or a few years after they’re first proposed. '
         '(The quicker the better, though, so that you can move on to a better '
         'one.)\n'
         'That’s why scientists—as opposed to climate scientists—try not to '
         'get too attached to their hypotheses.\n'
         'It’s not even a matter of “your” or “zis” or “zeir” hypothesis. The '
         'hypothesis is out there—you happen to be the one who thinks of it, '
         'and decides to test it.\n'
         'Very rarely, if you made a very lucky guess, the idea doesn’t fail. '
         'That’s great. You’ve advanced human knowledge a lot. Even more than '
         'you would have if your idea had been wrong.\n'
         'Let me say it again, in case you’re like most people and you had '
         'trouble making this paradigm shift straight away:\n'
         'forget about the climate wars. in REAL scientific '
         'controversies/contests of ideas/dialectics (and we’re talking about '
         'actual sciences, the fields that actually work, like every science '
         'before c. 1988), there is no role for any actor corresponding to the '
         '“skeptic/denier/disbeliever/naysayer/refusard.”\n'

         'LA Law, or any other TV courtroom classic. It’s not arcane or '
         'complicated or mysterious after all. You know the rules by now. It’s '
         'a competition between two teams who promote their mutually opposite '
         'ideas and then the jury (consisting of 12 muggles like me) votes on '
         'the winner.\n'

         'But the most horrifying thing here is the refrigerator. Heat stress '
         'and drought associated with climate change have reduced global '
         'yields of barley and pushed up prices. There is no beer.\n'
         'That link takes you to an article in “Nature Plants“, published on '
         'October 15th. Only this article is about projections for 2010-2100, '
         'not an analysis of past history. It takes the output of the RCP '
         'models, processes through a “process-based crop model” coupled with '
         'a “global economic model (Global Trade Analysis Project model)”. The '
         'model outputs are devoid of any common sense. Three examples.\n'
         'First, is under the RCP8.5 scenario in 2100 barley yields are '
         'projected to reduced by 17% on average globally compared to 2010. '
         'But in parts of Montana on the Dakotas yields are projected to '
         'double because of climate change. Some farmers in that region will '
         'not only get this for free, but get much higher prices. They are '
         'assumed too dumb to increase output.\n'
         'Second, after allowing for different taxes the price of a 500ml of '
         'beer is projected to rise by >$2 (>£1.50) more in Ireland by 2100 '
         'than in the UK. The beer is often out of the same brewery, and most '
         'is of international brands. It is assumed no-one has the wit to see '
         'the opportunity to make a fast buck by shipping a few containers of '
         'beer to Ireland.\n'
         'Then there are the costs. One of the cheapest beers in the UK is a '
         '4% alcohol lager costing £3.29 for 10*250ml bottles. Of this £2.54 '
         'is VAT and excise duty. £0.75 covers packaging, manufacturing '
         'overhead, transport, supermarket overhead as well as raw materials. '
         '10p or less is the barley cost. Yet a 17% fall in barley yields over '
         '90 years on its own will raise the price of those ten bottles to '
         '£5.00 or more.\n'
         'The way to stop a child’s ghoulish nightmare is to get them to wake '
         'up and turn the lights on. But in the world of “climate science“, '
         'turning on the light of understanding is verboten. The scary output '
         'of expert computer models, in peer-reviewed journals is the only '
         '“reality” allowed. That the “peers” of a biology journal have no '

         'Science has been around for the blink of an eye, culture since long '
         'before we were homo sapiens sapiens, and easily long enough to have '
         'co-evolved with our brain architecture. They entangle in various '
         'ways, and the whole of history demonstrates that the cultural modes '
         'which have dominated humanity for so long, are still easily able to '
         'impede or override science for longer or shorter periods. Especially '
         'that science which is perceived to have high social impact. Hawking '
         'is not a one off; because science is highly cellular, most '
         'scientists don’t see inside the other cells.\n'
         'For some reason you seem to think I’m unfamiliar with the scientific '
         'method. This is not so. I have a degree in physics and a whole '
         'career in a technical industry either in, or later associated with, '
         'design and development. I’ve seen Feynman’s excellent video long '
         'ago, and refreshed on occasion since. My position is absolutely not '
         'because I don’t understand what scientists do, and I am a huge '
         'supporter of science too and believe it can (eventually) crack '
         'everything, including how the most complex things we know (us) work. '
         'My stance is in light of this knowledge plus my aspirations for the '
         'triumph of science, but is especially also because I know something '
         'about the complex science of ‘us’, i.e. cultural evolution, social '
         'psychology, anthropology, evolutionary studies, etc. Everything this '
         'science has uncovered over 150 years points to the fact that being '
         'human, with all the attendant behaviours including in-group / '
         'out-group etc, can and constantly does at the group level, impede or '
         'trample over or straight-out hi-jack science, and at the individual '
         'level this does not imply in any way that scientists caught up in '
         'such wars are dysfunctional in any way, they are merely human.\n'
         'I still don’t get what your proposition actually is. Yet it seems to '
         'include that all scientists worth the name who get sucked into what '
         'future history will call the wrong side of the above wars, are all '
         '(as opposed to a very small minority) *consciously* betraying their '
         'calling in some manner. This seems incompatible with your agreement '
         'above that they are obviously not all lying. At any rate, such a '
         'view seems to defy history. Until recent times all scientists were '
         'religious. Many still are. The eugenics thing, the miasma thing, the '
         'tectonics thing, the recent saturated fats thing (a group-think '
         'consensus collapsed after 50 years, has likely adversely affected '
         'the health of hundreds of millions of people), and many more such. '
         'Plus of course the CAGW thing, involving thousands of scientists who '
         'do not raise sceptical questions, some indeed maybe because they do '
         'have inklings but are afraid to pursue these through fear of being '
         'called a denier (so from cultural pressure), far more because they '
         'are emotively swayed and have no reason to doubt and haven’t delved, '
         'and some because they more actively ‘religiously’ believe (and no, I '
         'do not equate ‘religious’ belief to evil, it is just the easiest way '
         'to express in a form everyone recognizes, the kind of cultural '
         'belief we are talking about). If we are to fully understand this '
         'historic and current battleground, we must pursue the science that '
         'unravels it; yet it seems to me that your approach would end up '
         'sacrificing this critical quest for a very unexplanatory, albeit '
         'maybe a more satisfying prospect, of individual blame. While certain '
         'individuals no doubt deserve to have the book thrown at them, '
         'pursuing that should not mean throwing away the findings of 150 '
         'years worth of scientific progress on understanding our minds and '
         'societies, which is starting to get a grip on much of this. That '
         'would indeed be a betrayal of the very enterprise you and I '
         'support.\n'
         'I could say a lot more, but I have already said enough I think. '
         'Probably far too much as some are fearing to lose themselves in '

         'Brad. I very much enjoyed your 8.45am post (verging on rant against '
         'that O woman). However, through much of it you proselytized for the '
         '“scientific” method or mindset, possibly without realizing what a '
         'crock of ordure those concepts, as they are usually conceived, '
         'actually are. As commonly conceived, the scientific method means '
         'deliberately abandoning a cherished hypothesis and deliberately '
         'testing it to death by searching for data or argument that will '
         'cause it to stillbirth. This deliberate murder is supposed to '
         'prevent a scientist becoming over fond of any explanation they may '
         'have conceived. I know of no scientist that works this way – quite '
         'the opposite. Commonly there are several explanations for data, and '
         'adherents to the different explanations. Do you really believe that '
         'each scientist strives to demolish their favoured interpretation and '
         'thereby give succour to their opponents?\n'
         'The common method of doing science is to concoct a hypothesis from '
         'part of the data, then use the remainder to determine if it is '
         'consistent with the hypothesis. Suppose it isn’t; do you think a '
         'scientist throws away the hypothesis? Of course they don’t, they '
         'search around for reasons to ignore or modify one’s understanding of '
         'the offending data, so preserving the integrity of the favoured '
         'hypothesis. Sometimes this reaches ludicrous heights as when '
         'temperature sonde data failed to find the “hotspot” and wind-speed '
         'data was used to infer temperature differences that favoured the '
         'original hypothesis.\n'
         'When I did my small bits of science, I admit I searched for '
         'confirming evidence for my interpretations. Why should I waste time '
         'deliberately searching for contrary evidence? That doesn’t mean that '
         'if I found contrary evidence that I deliberately suppressed it.\n'
         'I’m sorry Brad, but the scientific method as usually described, and '
         'as I believe you are using it, is not that put into practice.\n'

         'Grueling campaigns in other nations seem to consist of, at most, '

         'like gladiator matches, deep-fried dormice, and vomitoria that, I '
         'assume, made life more bearable back then.\n'
         'One manifestation of this malaise seems to be a rejection of '
         'science, at least by the more opportunistic of our politicians. I '
         'take this personally. Not only am I a professional scientist, but I '
         'enjoy the benefits of science in my everyday life. I love the '
         'internet, mostly. I love motorized transit and antibiotics and not '
         'having smallpox. There are more intangible things, too. Barring '
         'major, irresponsible advances in experimental physics, black hole '
         'thermodynamics will not solve the climate crisis. Dark energy is '
         'probably not going to make anyone rich. Literally no one will die if '
         'we don’t quantize gravity soon (although this would be an excellent '
         'plot for the next Bond movie; I am available to write and/or star). '
         'But still, how wonderful it is to belong to a species that thinks '
         'about such things. We can’t be all bad if we can land probes on '
         'comets and other planets, sequence genomes, and contemplate the '
         'multiverse even while sober.\n'
         'For me, though, the most wonderful thing about science is that it '
         'lets us talk to each other. We all experience the outside world '
         'through the prism of our own tastes, experiences, and biases. Some '
         'people have a rough time of things; others are sheltered and '
         'coddled. Some people like red; others prefer purple. Some people '
         'love dogs; other people are wrong. There has to be some way to '
         'engage with the reality we share, some way that we can all agree on '
         'what’s true enough to get on with. I don’t know that what I call '
         '“blue” is the same as what you see, but we can agree that the '
         'molecules in the atmosphere preferentially scatter particular '
         'wavelengths of light. Science is simply the least bad way to '
         'identify things that are the same for all of us: things on which we '
         'can agree. It gives us common ground. How else am I supposed to '
         'share a country with people who voluntarily eat at Applebees or '
         'listen to jazz?\n'
         'But sometimes this process tells us things that are disappointing, '
         'depressing, or downright frightening. I don’t like being reminded '
         'I’m going to die someday. I’m sad I’ll never travel backward in '
         'time, or have a fulfilling conversation with my dog, or acquire '
         'superpowers beyond the ability to eat an entire large pizza in one '
         'sitting. I wish we weren’t changing the climate by emitting '
         'greenhouse gases. I hate the second law of thermodynamics. But '
         'denying science doesn’t make these things any less true or real. '
         'And, more than that, by rejecting any semblance of shared reality, '
         'it alienates everyone else who has to live there.\n'
         'So why do our politicians insist on saying silly things about '
         'science? Is it our fault for communicating badly? I don’t think '
         'scientists are any worse at talking to the public than anyone else. '
         'However, we persist in the endearing but misguided belief that yet '
         'another extended report on subjects guaranteed to fire the public '
         'imagination (“Bayesian model evaluation”, “tropospheric specific '
         'humidity”) will somehow make everyone believe us. And we’re not '
         'immune to jargon. I imagine I am not alone in believing '
         '“stakeholders”, instead of being “engaged” or “integrated”, would be '
         'more productively put to use in fighting vampires.\n'
         'It strikes me, though, that there are deeper things at work here. '
         'Denying science is fundamentally polarizing: if you lead people to a '
         'fantasy world through magical thinking, those of us left behind are '
         'less able to understand anything you say. This is a powerful way to '
         'elevate the subjective tastes and ideologies that divide us above '
         'the realities, however imperfectly grasped, that unite us. By '
         'rejecting the scientific method or the results that emerge from it, '
         'politicians can create useful cliques: impenetrable to outsiders, '
         'and bound together by a powerful shared untruth. It’s not surprising '
         'that many of them use such an effective tool, but it makes me sad '
         'that they do.\n'

         '(everything tastes better with hot sauce, it is better to die with '
         'honor than to ask for directions) is that sometimes it’s possible to '
         'get along with, even love, people with whom you disagree. But I '
         'don’t think this would be possible if there weren’t at least some '
         'common ground. We agree that the sky is blue, the earth is round, '
         'the Universe is expanding, and the climate is changing. Science and '
         'reason make it possible for us to live together, in the same house '
         'or the same world. It gives all of us something to agree on, at '
         'least until new discoveries overturn or supplement what we thought '
         'to be true. We need more to live together: art, music, the ability '
         'to listen to each other. But acknowledging reality is a bloody good '

         'Apologies and thank you for pointing out that you DO know how '
         'science works. My attempts to explain it at great length must '
         'therefore have seemed patronising, at best. Oops!\n'
         'I can only plead, by way of explanation, to having suffered, until '
         'you set me straight, an (unusually vivid) false memory syndrome '
         'whereby the curriculum vitae of a certain similarly-erudite critic '
         'of climatism, whose only crime is to lack a science degree, was '
         'somehow attributed to you in my mind. I won’t tell you who I had you '
         'mixed up with (although the conflation is far from insulting to '
         'either one of you).\n'
         'But having once slotted you into that incorrect schema, I seemed to '
         'find confirmatory evidence in your arguments (and no doubt missed '
         'much falsifying evidence). But I’ll have to read them again before '
         'pressing you further on it.\n'
         'On your substantive points…. cross purposes strike again, I’m '
         'afraid. The cause of our latest needless disagreement is that we '
         'have been insufficiently careful to distinguish normative from '
         'descriptive characterisations of [how] science/scientists [work].\n'
         'You point out, incontrovertibly, that scientists do not always '
         'adhere to the scientific method.\n'
         'I know. I plead no contest. I’m neither inclined nor able to dispute '
         'it, let alone when it’s redundantly backed up by your episodic '
         'knowledge.\n'
         'In other words, how science is done and how it should be done are '
         'materially different things.\n'
         'I’m more interested in the latter, since the Method is what '
         'separates us from the 16th century Transylvanian peasant.\n'
         'So whenever I talk about “how it wotks,” I’m talking about “how it '
         'has to work in order to deserve to be called science.”\n'
         'Talking about the thousand little betrayals of the method that '
         'scientists commit every day doesn’t interest me much. Of course we '
         'can’t and shouldn’t pretend they don’t happen. But since nobody '
         'pretends that, I don’t see how any further benefit is likely to '
         'emerge from having an entire “sociology” of the human-all-too-human '
         'condition of carbon-based flesh-and-blood scientists.\n'
         'Their deviations are regrettable and necessarily deleterious to the '
         'quality of the work. There’s no POINT or PURPOSE in deviating, they '

         'laziness and forgetfulness and status-lust.\n'
         'So I’ve never understood why people are fascinated by the subject of '
         'these deviations. They’re unfortunate. That’s it. Not interesting, '

         'Yawn.\n'
         'These deviations can NOT account for how one of the smartest species '
         'on earth managed to come up with the climate religion.\n'
         'The climate religion arose because of soi-disant scientists who '
         'didn’t even PRETEND to try to follow the scientific method.\n'
         'It’s one thing to fall short in your adherence to a norm. It’s '
         'another, more interesting and dangerous thing when scientists STOP '
         'TRYING to adhere to it.\n'
         'Entire faculties of climate science have *abandoned* the scientific '
         'method. Not *fallen short of its ideals*, but JETTISONED them. '
         'Renounced them in favor of what they euphemise as a Post-Normal '

         'producing knowledge or human progress of any sort.\n'
         'Well, OK, they might march us boldly towards a political goal, but '
         'not towards “the truth” (or knowledge thereof).\n'
         'It is rather uncontroversially (I would’ve thought) a “crock of '

         '(But who imagines, or would have anyone else imagine, that this is '

         'There are competitors for the glory of backing the winning '

         'That’s not the purpose of it, from humanity’s point of view. That’s '

         'for conjectural baselessness\n'
         '– once he or ze becomes aware of this, a scientist is NOT allowed to '
         'claim otherwise. Perhaps they don’t have a positive duty to *oppose* '
         'alarmism unless it’s relevant to their research, but if they '
         '*endorse* alarmism they have betrayed my goddess Mut, and their '
         'blood is upon their own heads, even unto the fourth generation of '
         'their line, that the destruction of their house may be as an example '
         'to all nations.\n'
         '– silence is not morally defensible, mind you, if they’re climate '
         'scientists, because in that case they know damn fucking well that '
         'their field is a cancer on the taxpayer, because it’s scientifically '

         'rot in debtors’ prison until their families ransom them out (by '
         'getting together enough money/jewelry/expensive paintings to refund '
         'the taxpayer, with interest). Embezzlement must not be allowed to '
         'pay.\n'
         '– any scientist who knows what Oreskes is up to has an active moral '
         'duty (having earned the white labcoat of professor /. doctor '
         'scientiae, WHICH MEANS ‘TEACHER’) to speak out and arrest her '

         '‘You point out, incontrovertibly, that scientists do not always '
         'adhere to the scientific method.’\n'
         'This is not what I have stressed, I think you may be confusing me '
         'with Alan. It’s true of course, as you note. Yet even if the '
         'scientists themselves believe that they are executing it perfectly '
         '(which Alan points out that they very usually know that they are not '
         'so doing), my points about how humanity works (at the deepest '
         'levels, gene-culture co-evolution) and what that means for science '
         'and culture wars, still stand.\n'
         '“you said “don’t get me started on publication bias” or words to '
         'that effect.”\n'
         'I did not. You are definately confusing me with Alan here.\n'
         '“On your substantive points…. ”\n'
         'hmmm… I’m afraid you don’t really seem to addressing any of these as '
         'far as I can tell. To reiterate my own response on one of your own…\n'
         '“– it’s trivially obvious—to any scientist with mens sana who '
         'investigates the CAGW debate for zimself—that the hypothesis has '
         'ZERO evidence in its favor, which is practically an all-time record '
         'for conjectural baselessness”\n'
         'It is not. If this were true, phenomena such as CAGW could not '
         'exist. Clearly they do, and have done throughout history, and from '
         'aeons before science when it was merely generic reason they were '
         'hi-jacking and not the more formal child that is the scientific '
         'method. You remove a main strut that supports phenomena like this, '
         'and yet have no explanatory replacement. It is wrong because if a '
         'scientist (or anyone else) is emotively infected (albeit we must '
         'take care regarding the literal meaning of that word) before they '
         'start investigating, their brain hardware is literally switched such '
         'that they’ll only be able to see those things which are consistent '
         'with orthodoxy. So then they won’t be lying to us about what they '
         'find, parts of their brain have lied to the conscious them, who then '
         'relate to us what they believe is the truth. And I suspect CAGW is '
         'not a record in this respect either, it has wider complexity skirts '
         'to hide behind than some other socially disputed science issues. '
         'Hint: the way to challenge this response is not to simply repeat '
         'that any scientist who looks into climate science must and can only '
         'find a crock.\n'
         'Geoff says: “…It would be nice if we could get further in '
         'understanding the underlying reasons for the thousand little '
         'betrayals…”\n'
         'We have about 150 years of scientific progress across multiple '
         'disciplines which goes a long way to telling us how the whole show '
         'works. Including the thousand cuts, the publication bias, a raft of '
         'other biases, and why it is that even if / when scientists '
         'themselves think they are doing their very best and are at least '
         'avoiding most of what can be consciously avoided in Alan’s list of '
         'imperfections, the cultural hi-jacking of science would still occur '
         '(albeit needing particular circumstances to get started; a topic '
         'having high social impact and which also has high uncertainty).\n'
         'back to Brad…\n'
         'I’m familiar with some medieval Islamic science, mostly medical. '
         'Early science, even the earliest proto-formal efforts from ancient '
         'Greece, had some distinct advantages as well as disadvantages '
         'relative to science execution in modern times. One of the advantages '
         'was that you didn’t need a large enterprise – a large enterprise '
         'level effort needs co-ordination amongst many, and the chief means '
         'that humans have for co-ordination, is unfortunately, culture. Hence '
         'a major opening for biases and even hi-jack. Another problem in '
         'modern times is a symptom of success, a public belief in science '
         'that is strong enough to become a cultural issue itself, i.e. '
         'believing any old nonsense *if* the messaging that it is science '
         'gets locked in before the truth can catch up. Well all the debacles '
         'in climate science and medicine and the misapplication of statistics '
         'just about everywhere, may end up solving this problem for us soon.\n'
         'To cut what might be a long response short, I think you seem to have '
         'completely missed my points and position 0: But indeed we may be '
         'exchanging in Greek versus Urdu. I’m applying the relevant science '
         'of how we and our societies work to get insight on the social '
         'phenomenon of CAGW, and seems to be a pretty damn good fit to '
         'expectations too. What science are you using? If you are using none, '
         'why would you throw overboard all the hard-won findings that the '
         'enterprise we both so admire has rooted out over generations against '
         'some of the heaviest resistance science has faced, this being '
         'because humans generally don’t take very kindly at all to the '
         'prospect that their thoughts and actions can be ‘dissected’ (as they '
         'might put it), by science. And indeed what we know so far can be '
         'pretty uncomfortable regarding what we like to believe about '
         'ourselves, as the title of neuro-scientist Michael Ganzzaniga’s book '
         'intimates (Who’s in Charge?) BUT… we must follow science wherever it '
         'leads, however uncomfortable.\n'

         'plus clashed with more basic realities in whatever era. Ditto for '
         'every single extremist political movement including whole hosts of '
         'them now forgotten that crashed into existing law and reason and '
         'morality. In every single instance where dogma and the heavy head of '
         'enforced consensus has prevented science from getting to the real '
         'solutions, for years or maybe generations (the internet is your '
         'friend), whether entangled / pushed by culture writ larger per above '

         'merely via smaller scale group-think that nevertheless even on its '
         'own can do tremendous damage (e.g. the saturated fats thing and the '
         'health of whole nations). Very many cases of group-think bringing '
         'down businesses and business institutions (I quoted the Enron case '
         'above, where climategate behavioural parallels are apparent). You '
         'have to remove from your head the domain specifics, e.g. religious, '
         'political, science or business, or which flavour of same. Regarding '
         'the similarity of group-think behaviour in every domain, it is '
         'literally written into our DNA. Technology such as writing and '
         'printing and email appears to help with detection of ethical issues, '
         'yet at the same time it helps with the reach and reactive speed of '
         'cultural enforcement. It helps both sides. The social phenomenon of '
         'CAGW is the first ‘biggy’ that has most of its rise recorded in the '
         'age of email and the internet, yet the internet is awash with '
         'scandals in other less high-profile areas (some overlapping, some '
         'not), such as second-hand smoking science, insecticide science, the '
         'saturated fats thing (though unfortunately much of the early rise in '
         'the 50s to 70s before internet), or whatever. The scale and public '
         'availability of detail in CAGW just reflects the sheer size and '
         'resource profile of the cultural wave (and hence also efforts '
         'opposing it via FoE or any other means). But throughout history such '
         'scandals frequently don’t bring down a culture because adherents are '
         'all looking at them with pre-configured h/w in their heads, and '
         'what’s done for the cause gets very wide latitude indeed. Including '
         'issues that are a consequence of similar behaviours but are not '
         'science entangled, the huge scandal of priests and paedophilia is '
         'obviously a pretty well documented one by now. This has gone much '
         'further than climate science transgressions, only happening because '
         'the law and moral safeguards that are supposed to be in place were '
         'disabled / blind-sided by the supposed moral stance of the culture. '
         'Will it bring down the two millennia old culture of the Catholic '
         'church – no way. Will most adherents continue to believe as they did '
         'before? Yes. Will it cause damage? Yes. The social phenomenon of '

         'And even if they did, this doesn’t mean that society will believe '

         'in theory lead to a much better, much more efficient, game play in '
         'opposing the culture at the front-line, so to speak, pending a wider '
         'realisation, although I don’t partake in this personally, that isn’t '

         '“when has this kind of thing (IN SCIENCE) happened before?”\n'
         'I gave some examples above. To be a little more expansive, for '
         'instance the consensuses on: static continents, the motion of blood, '
         'miasma, cause of ulcers, doctors and ‘superfluous’ hand washing, '
         'Ptolemaic system, saturated fats cause heart disease, and obesity '
         'plus diabetes, eugenics, bloodletting. These were not perceived as '
         'interim concepts to evolve from (I guess there must be many '
         'thousands of those). These consensuses were enforced, socially '
         'promoted, clung to and defended against evidence (much of which in '
         'retrospect seems blindingly obvious), sometimes over generations and '
         'sometimes with much damage. There are more purported such behaviours '
         'in modern times on various conflicted issues, which I have not '
         'pursued, so for instance within the second hand smoking conflict and '
         'various insecticide science disputes including the one about bees '
         'and neocotinoids. Some seem to match, yet because controversies on '
         'most of these modern ones are still raging, it is indeed very '
         'difficult with only a brief look to know whether the enforced '
         'consensuses are indeed scientific or cultural; the social profile of '
         'such disputes are only a tiny fraction of CAGW so there is '
         'effectively no social data to work with that could prove a cultural '
         'consensus was operating. As another example, I have tended to go '
         'with the majority view on DDT over the years (why wouldn’t I?), but '
         'the long ban was recently lifted for bounded use, the entry in '
         'rationwiki looks like it was written by what in the climate domain '
         'we might call an ultra-orthodox (‘Horrifically stupid wingnuts and '
         'experts for hire will sometimes imply that a supposed worldwide ban '
         'on DDT has killed millions of people by giving them malaria’), and '
         'rather worryingly Oreskes waded in to defend the consensus against '
         'Lomborg and others. Do you know on which side science stands? Both '
         'sides accuse each other of flawed papers, cherry picking, etc. the '
         'usual list. The involvement of Oreskes should not bias our view if '
         'we are ‘special’ scientists, determination should only be via strict '
         'analysis of the (highly conflicted) data, but it probably will. '
         'There’s a good case to make that the negative impact of eugenics has '
         'so far exceeded any damage caused by CAGW, certainly in terms of '
         'direct deaths. And if you’d lived in times past I think those '
         'various hugely wrong medical science consensuses might have bothered '
         'you. What all these have in common is not ‘a few dodgy scientists’ '
         'as you allude to above, they are systemic failures and most '
         'supporting the consensuses were doing so in good faith. As you also '
         'intimate, many similar such failings have probably never made it to '
         'the public ear.\n'
         'Science is an anti-cultural enterprise, it disproves the myths upon '
         'which culturally enforced consensuses are based. Yet it’s a war that '
         'goes both ways. Scientists are human, and are not special at all '
         'regarding proof against the behavioural effects associated with '
         'cultural belief and in-group / out-group narratives. We know this '
         'because the science of humans and human societies tells us so, as '
         'noted above. There are very many theories and big bun fights about '
         'all the whys and wherefores (a comforting sign of a lack of enforced '
         'consensus!), but no-one I know of is saying that our reasoning '
         'machinery is *not* affected significantly by our emotive machinery, '
         'of which part of the latter is engaged by culture and indeed evolved '
         'to support cultures for in-group / out-group enforcement. So '
         'generally speaking over a confluence of various disciplines, science '
         'agrees that scientists are not special. You can’t conform to the '
         'scientific method if your hardware has been reconfigured without '
         'your knowledge; those afflicted to a greater or lesser extent by '
         'cultural influence are not lying about their findings, parts of '
         'their brain are lying to their conscious (noting per above various '
         'caveats such as liars are bolted onto any human enterprise that is '
         'large enough, etc), which they relay honestly.\n'

         'Some or none is irrelevant if a culture takes over. What it usually '
         'means is that even in perfectly good faith (i.e. before the culture '
         'took over), there certainly appeared to be some at one point in '
         'time, which in the normal order of things would eventually have been '
         'disproved later as science ground forward. But because a culture did '
         'take over, it became fossilised as a useful part of its '
         'unchallengable consensus. That consensus is still cultural and still '
         'wrong, and the process via which it takes over is identical, this is '
         'just a nuance in its starting conditions, albeit it is a common '
         'complication for folks who would like to know which side is right '
         'before they get old, and have little hope of doing so. Plus cultures '
         'are adept at re-framing correct things such that they appear to '
         'support the cultural case; the labyrinthine ways of culture are a '
         'big challenge to our understanding. (For instance a very simple '
         'example: we both agreed above that AGW might well be just fine, and '
         'in my wholly unsupported opinion is fine to some unknown strength, '
         'so will be used as a first credibility step in a cultural persuasion '
         'on CAGW). There are few cases where one can be definitive based on '
         'social data alone (you cannot use physical data on the actual domain '
         'issue – you don’t know what is right!) The social phenomenon of CAGW '
         'is one because it is so big and has such a high social profile, plus '
         'a lot of its action is recorded on the internet. But for somewhat '
         'different reasons, we can be definitive about creationism too, so '
         'even if we were a robot from Mars that knew nothing about '
         'evolutionary theory at all, if we knew how to make the cultural test '
         'we would still know that creationism is wrong. This is a useful '
         'validating benchmark.\n'
         '“To a starving man who’s spent 30 years looking for a crust of '
         'bread, even a CRUMB of bread would be a miracle, woudn’t it?”\n'
         'Indeed I think you are resorting to a crumb 😉\n'
         '“in every case, there was SOME scientific excuse for believing in '
         'the false idea, whether or not it was a particularly good excuse, '
         'wasn’t there?”\n'
         'To start with, see above. Also, for the older ones we didn’t live in '
         'the times. For the newer ones the domains are too closed to us (or '
         'at least in my case, I presume for you too), and would remain opaque '
         'without years of insertion, and even then the available social and '
         'domain data is never going to match the case for the social '
         'juggernought of CAGW. So we are not in a good position to make any '
         'judgement on the relative credulity factor for each conflict / '
         'consensus. But there are some insights available from history and '
         'social studies, plus I have an anecdotal gem from an ex-teacher who '
         'I think I mentioned above, who opined that (in similar mode to '
         'yourself) one would have to be crazy to believe in the static '
         'continents theory, which nevertheless ruled for 50 years and across '
         'his own training; he had to bow to it or get no qualification. From '
         'all such hints I don’t think CAGW is really any different, and '
         'certainly not regarding the underlying causes. Cultures are strong '
         'enough to make essentially everyone (in only recent history) believe '
         'in nonsensical fairy-tales of various kinds so deeply and '
         'passionately, that they go around skewering each other or burning '
         'each other at the stake for only minor differences of orthodox '
         'interpretation (endemic when a culture splits in two); they’re still '
         'doing it now. Regarding such persuasive power, the uncertainty that '
         'by definition accompanies the many leading edges of science, is '
         'easily enough to act as a host for a cultural start-ups if the topic '
         'is one of high social impact. And for nascent science if something '
         '(catastrophe, miasma, whatever) can’t be definitively *disproved*, '
         'then that’s plenty enough ground to cite ‘evidence for’ if such is '
         'framed in the right way, which then folks like us can’t ever unravel '
         'in the vast majority of cases. Obviously no case is identical, but I '
         'think it’s special pleading to say this one is different, and in any '
         'case diverts us from what really matters, the common causes of them '

         'Had a bad cough for days and it’s this screen or the TV in bed. I’m '
         'happy to uncover the reasoning, which I guess because it is not '
         'simple might have caused you somewhere up-thread to detect a whiff '
         'of the complexity beneath, and baulk. And I know you like things to '
         'be black and white, but there are caveats to everything in this '
         'game. The cultural thing tells us that the narrative is outright '
         'false, and also that this narrative existed long before AR5, within '
         'which there are mentions of abrupt climate change *possibilities* '
         '(e.g. regional methane clathrates induced), yet nevertheless *not* '
         'support for a high confidence of global catastrophe (which is what '
         'the narrative claims). I normally don’t like to incorporate any '
         'science output into my positions, because the cultural result is '
         'both clear and unbiased (there is no domain data in it, only social '
         'data), whereas weighting an answer from the science output can '
         'introduce some domain bias. However, I’m comfortable that adding '
         'this *mainstream* AR5 result (i.e. not a fringe result from either '
         'side) to the cultural result, is equivalence to ‘zero evidence’, '
         'though the cultural result alone cannot speak to this directly. '
         'Plus, output from the small minority of non-mainstream scientists at '
         'the opposite fringe to skeptics (they are generally very vocal about '
         'their approaches) looks currently to be a clear case of sexing up '
         'later possibilities to try and match their original cultural '
         'narrative, so just due to rampant bias. Yet this whole situation may '
         'not remain the case for AR6 and associated messaging which both may '
         'become more sophisticated regarding these possibilities, say, which '
         'at some point via mainstream effort / approval might well make it '
         'onto your measly scale. This wouldn’t change the fact that the '
         'catastrophe claim is cultural, so it is still (i.e. in terms of '
         'claimed high confidence) completely wrong, and indeed still '
         'pre-dated the science that is supposed to support it. Yet while the '
         'IPCC AR6 position is likely to be mildly incremental at most, there '
         'is an outside chance that abrupt change possibilities and potential '
         'cascade possibilities may be addressed further for AR6; and there do '
         'seem to be more scientists lately complaining of extreme IPCC '
         'conservatism on these fronts, so they may try to move the needle, '
         'indeed may also be biased enough to sex that stuff up more. Of '
         'course it makes no difference to the big picture, but measly is not '
         'zero, and that could happen. It’s also the case of course that any '
         'future sexing up may be challengable with relative ease or could be '
         'very difficult to challenge, and of course some *could* be true, but '
         'either way certainly only via intricate domain knowledge, so this '
         'becomes one more part of the conflict, and a part I do not have '
         'expertise for so the backstop for me is then the cultural result '
         'only. Or in short the science could go more fuzzy, it may stump up '
         'apparent non-zero evidence, whether due to bias or real work, the '
         'social data won’t be able to say, although either way the cultural '
         'narrative it purports to support will still be flat wrong. So for '
         'sure I wouldn’t maintain the zero claim once AR6 is out, unless and '
         'until it has been thoroughly dissected by folks of all views and '
         'shown not to have moved from AR5 in this respect (indeed I waited to '
         'see a range of AR5 opinion in the past), and this is also why I '
         'always point to AR5 as well as the cultural result if folks want the '
         'comfort factor that mainstream science says it’s bunkum too. For me '
         'personally though, knowing that the narrative of catastrophe is '
         'cultural, is enough; everything that happens in the domain is '
         'explainable from this single fact, and the physical science details '

         '“If cultural constraints are so all encompassing…”\n'
         'They are not all encompassing, and I’ve not said so in this thread '
         'or anywhere else. Cultural behaviours certainly loom very large in '
         'our lives, and much more more so in the deeper past, yet science and '
         'the law and to a smaller extent political systems like democracy, '
         'are anti-cultural engines. Science being the strongest, the law less '
         'so because it is founded at the deepest level on moral principles '
         'and morals are to a large extent cultural values. A huge amount of '
         'science happens fine without the notice of major culture, beneath '
         'the radar so to speak, because it is not perceived to have social '
         'impact. So you’ve only got some minor scale group-think to avoid, a '
         'perennial annoyance but by no means majorly damaging overall. Other '
         'topics are high profile, conflicted, like climate change, GMOs, and '
         'others. And critical argument works fine where strong cultural '
         'biases are not in play. The interesting thing here is that we all '
         'have different biases related to the several cultural affinities we '
         'possess, hence someone may be really biased about subjects that '
         'challenge their religion, but not at all biased on climate change, '
         'or vice versa, ditto regarding other conflicted topics. So there are '
         'always people who are not particularly biased on any given topic, '
         'and critical discussion can hence typically progress despite the '
         'presence of some (differently) biased folks in the room (though '
         'no-one has literally zero bias in all domains). But yes its often a '
         'war too, and polarization is common at times, like in the US now. '
         'And while science erodes cultures, they can fight back so to speak '
         '(they are not alive of course), and seriously influence or outright '
         'hi-jack science. So culture looms large, but by no means is '
         'everything a slave to cultural behaviour, most folks hardly even '
         'think of it most of the time I guess, even though it guides *some* '
         'of what they do and think is important. However having said all that '
         'about our times, which you may or may not have wanted to hear, '
         'regarding how all these anti-cultural things developed, the current '
         'opinion is I believe still that the Ancient Greeks were the main '

         'story and way of living, how it was ‘right’ to behave etc. The '
         'critical leap for them is therefore realising that these apparently '
         'invariant systems are not absolute after all, they are relative. So '
         'they started to develop critical reasoning and formal skepticism, to '
         'try and weigh all these different systems they encountered, and '
         'classify them, and hopefully find beneath them more universal truths '
         'that they could live by. This made more objective and sophisticated '

         'Yes. Their main reason for existence is to create the in-group '

         '“Can you be a member of multiple cultures?”\n'
         'Absolutely. So a religious, xyz party, believer in catastrophic '

         'some kind of national / regional identity culture too and maybe '
         'others. A difficulty comes if the values of some of these cultures '

         'and exchange between 2 cultures, they can be said to be in alliance, '
         'as CAGW is with Dem / Libs in the US, which hence pulls in the '

         'the US public don’t believe or oppose the narrative of climate '
         'catastrophe because they’ve looked into the science and either '
         'accepted it or rejected it on the basis of some reasoned assessment. '
         'They believe or oppose based simply on their political affiliation, '
         'i.e. (a big portion of) their identity. As noted up-thread, even if '
         'they do go off looking at domain information, their search and trust '

         'The question of allocation of blame for stepping over legal, moral, '
         'corporate, and science, rule books due to strong cultural influence, '
         'is highly fraught to say the least, because the whole topic is '
         'fiendishly complicated. Part of the complication comes from the fact '
         'that we don’t fully know what’s happening in the brain, yet we do '
         'know it is deeply architected and appears to be involuntary. Another '
         'part is that the cultural rise that caused the individual to act the '
         'way they did, is usually busy pushing legal and moral and corporate '
         'code in its own favour and so the ground the offender stepped upon '
         'is often therefore shifting anyhow, or artificially bulged, e.g. a '
         'court system and the judges may have excess sympathy not really due '
         'according to the letter of the law, because they too are influenced '
         'by the rising culture. Science is different in that culture can’t '
         'really change its rules, yet because of the uncertainties in all '
         'nascent science (not to mention usually great complexity and '
         'required enterprise level co-ordination), and because culture '
         'reprograms the brain h/w scientists’ are actually using to execute '
         'their work, there is still ample scope for ‘offending’ the ideal of '
         'science in all sorts of ways, big and small. Yet most science '
         '‘offences’ are not viewed as serious by society anyhow, and those '
         'climate scientists stepping up a grade to break the law are tiny in '
         'number (Hansen for obstruction in rallies, Gleick for wire-tap, '
         'although I’m not sure he’s even a climate scientist as such). In the '
         'end, the great majority of them are working in good faith and '
         'believe that they are doing a good job even where they are strongly '
         'influenced by the narrative of catastrophe (perhaps especially so). '
         'It is difficult to allocate blame to such folks, they are just being '
         'human, even the ones who preach the catastrophe gospel, like say '
         'Hayhoe or Marvel (we rightly don’t sanction catholic priests just '
         'for being priests, despite their narratives are nonsense). However a '
         'larger minority (albeit still small), are those driven by noble '
         'cause to bend or break the science rules even if not the law, be it '
         'on say hiding data (that they fear the ‘deniers’ will ‘misuse’), '
         'helping keep the ‘deniers’ out of the journals, or whatever other '
         'transgression. And they aren’t lying about whey think ‘deniers’ '
         'represent. I think we should apply the maximum sanction and public '
         'proclamation of sanction that is possible to such folks, yet as you '
         'noted cultural armies protect them, they even protected Gleick, '
         'whose actual legal offence became almost a badge of honour and no '
         'hinderance to his career after a modest pause for the sake of '
         'appearances. Scattered across these cases are those of many folks '
         'placed in intolerable conditions (a bit like your jury experience '
         'but all the time – the real case of the good Germans is very highly '
         'informative in this respect), and a few who would likely behave '
         'badly anyhow whatever trade they’re in and whatever culture they '
         'belong to, and some who are just tempted by greed (not cultural) for '
         'money or positional reward and take advantage of cultural cover '
         '(which hence is not due to cultural influence, it is still just '
         'greed). The whole thing is so big now we can expect every possible '
         'scenario to turn up.\n'
         'In general society penalises the crossing of ‘big’ lines even if it '
         'is due to the particular self-deception invoked by cultural '
         'influence (think of it as partial hypnosis, there is little chance '
         'the individual could truly recognise their deep reconfiguration or '
         'defeat it), for instance the euthanizing of the disabled in Germany '
         'by medics (who egged each other on to do this as a team for the '
         'cultural good, they were not ordered top down to do it). However, '
         'even then I point out that had Germany won, they would not have '
         'faced sanction. Sanction is culturally relative. Society typically '
         'does not penalise the crossing of ‘small’ lines that is due to the '
         'particular self-deception invoked by cultural influence, even where '
         'the culture that caused it fails to become dominant or alter the '
         'rules in its favour. This is a recognition that the '
         '‘semi-hypnotised’ state of the offender was the major factor, and in '
         'the end there wasn’t a clash between this and any of the ‘big’ '
         'lines. There’s a lot of grey ground in there though, and if the '
         'culture does become a biggy, the chief problem is not what sanction '
         'ought to be applied, but rather that bias within the law / corporate '
         'system / moral adjudication, will mitigate or skip the sanction '
         'anyhow. So… I for one am not going to come out with any judgement '
         'about scientists in general – look at each individual case '
         'objectively on its details – but for the fickle finger of fate we '
         'ourselves might be under such a judgemental gaze. No-one on Earth '
         'has a magic protection against falling to cultural bias, perhaps '
         'falling far, and this includes scientists.\n'

         'more developed (thereby having more sophisticated and diverse '
         'cultures). Plus the Greeks were inherently more diverse to start '
         'with, due to their island dispersal and (researched) different '
         'cultures on various ones, whereas the Carthaginians (originally from '
         'Tyre) were much more culturally homogeneous (incidentally I visited '
         'an early Carthaginian site in Sicily two years ago). A great deal of '
         'the Polynesian expansion (it came in phases, and the original '
         'population probably out of Taiwan), reached places with no existing '
         'population or very undeveloped populations, so much less cultural '
         'diversity / grist for the mill. It also started when they themselves '

         'Golly, I don’t recall any of the names. But just in one genre you '
         'must recall the endless list of maverick police / investigators / '
         'agents that beat up a minor bad guy to get intel that leads to the '
         'boss, that burgled suspect premises without sufficient evidence to '
         'obtain a warrant because they ‘knew’ there was something '
         'incriminating in there, that dealt out street justice because they '
         'knew that the courts would give the ‘wrong’ answer, this and many '
         'similar stunts are all illegal! And this is from the supposed '
         'enforcers. As a side-branch of that genre (less bad yet more like '
         'the Wirth trick) where the hero / heroine are a lawyer / pathologist '
         'or other part of the legal system, breaking of court timing / '
         'procedure but in a dramatic and ‘right’ way that gets them the '
         'emotive clincher out of the judge / jury, breaking legal ethics to '
         'talk to witnesses for the other side or someone else they’re not '
         'supposed to, in a secluded spot somewhere, slowing their work to '
         'allow the ‘right’ line of investigation to catch up, even conniving '
         'to extend the freedom of the ‘wrong’ suspects so that they can help '
         'prove their own innocence, etc. These are sometimes illegal and '
         'sometimes just ethical transgressions, but would warrant firing if '
         'found out (and extra drama is generated in some series of course by '
         'them occasionally being found out, yet then miraculously reinstated '
         'on special pleading). This is all just in the crime genre, but it '
         'spreads out to other dramas. You surely have seen?? It’s not only a '
         'norm, it’s pretty much an aspiration. I presume this common meme is '
         'to feed our sense of frustration at the apparent clumsiness of due '
         'process, and comfort us that some folks who know the real ‘truth’ '
         'out there will fix it for us. But in the real world there is no such '
         'truth of that kind. Come to think of it few of the super-heroes work '
         'with the law too, some are basically just vigilantes. Even in Gotham '
         'city, where the police dept typically asks for help with the bat '
         'signal, making Batman an auxiliary officer, he breaks all the rules '
         'of evidence and practically everything else the state would normally '
         'have to conform to. In the real world, it is often necessary to '
         'break the law to make progress, like Rosa Parks on the bus, Ghandi, '
         'Nelson Mandela, etc. ‘New’ culture hits the law and morals (and '
         'sometimes science), head on, but ‘new’ can be viewed by future '
         'history as good or bad. It is only the future history that can '
         'judge; as I noted above there’s a (vanishing small, thankfully) '
         'chance that there’ll be a bronze statue of Hansen one day, with his '
         'hand pulling the plug on an aircon unit – not because of climate '
         'catastrophe, but because the culture lasted long enough to claim '
         'victory. We like the inflexibility of the law when it impedes '
         'culture we don’t like (many didn’t like what Rosa Parks '
         'represented); we dislike it when it impedes the newer cultural '
         'values we aspire to. Indeed there are memes on film too saying how '
         'those who stuck to the letter of the law under tremendous '
         'psychological and moral pressure not to, somehow ended up saving the '
         'day too (don’t force me to come up with names!) Life is a balance, '

         'You acknowledged that ‘science is different’ [in some specified '

         'Interestingly, one way science differs from other epistemologies '
         '(including forensic/legal ones) is that it’s nonsensical, IN '
         'SCIENCE, to say “I KNOW it, I’ve just got to find the EVIDENCE.”\n'
         'Cops on TV say this all the time. (No need to name the shows, I’ve '
         'seen them too.) Heck, *scientists* on TV have been known to say it.\n'
         'But that’s absurd because, IN SCIENCE, knowledge is the cart, '
         'evidence is the horse.\n'
         'So the scientific equivalent of planting evidence on the suspect you '
         '“know” is a baddie would NOT be a heroic or admirable act or even a '
         'debatable ethical grey zone. It would be wrong, by definition—it '
         'would make you a baddie.\n'
         'That’s because IN SCIENCE the aim isn’t to share truth, but to share '
         'knowledge, which is conditioned upon evidence.\n'
         'Consider why we damn Phil Jones for “hiding the decline.”\n'
         'Some opponents have told me, apparently sincerely, that they don’t '
         'see what the big deal was—after all, they say, the proxy signal was '
         'wrong after 1960, so why mislead the audience with incorrect data? '
         'Jones did the only honest thing: he replaced a segment he knew was '
         'false with a more accurate signal. And you deniers are crucifying '
         'him for his honesty!\n'
         'Consider why that reasoning, however well-meaning, is '

         'difference between how the Sokal sides see things—but although '
